I need some pointers regarding importing a csv file with rails.  

I have the code below in /lib/tasks/import.rake 

        require 'csv'
            CSV.foreach("lib/articles.csv", headers: true, encoding: "ISO8859-1") do |row|
                @article = Article.new(title: row["Article title"], body: row["Body"], user: User.find(1))
        end

When I run rake `import:articles`

I get this error:
NameError: uninitialized constant Article
        /Users/justinMgrant/code/hrsurvival/lib/tasks/import.rake:8:in `block in <top (required)>'
        /Users/justinMgrant/code/hrsurvival/lib/tasks/import.rake:7:in `<top (required)>'

        /Users/justinMgrant/code/hrsurvival/Rakefile:6:in `<top (required)>'
        (See full trace by running task with --trace)

Any idea what Iâ€™m doing wrong?
