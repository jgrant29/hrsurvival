    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;p class="one"&gt;As an HR professional you are no stranger to paperwork. It seems that for every employment action – applying, interviewing, hiring, disciplining, on and on – there is a specific form that needs to be filled out. Making sure you complete the paperwork properly is only half the battle though. Once you finish completing a form, you are faced with a whole new issue: what to do with it.  Being the smarty that you are, you know that proper documentation is key in protecting your company in the unfortunate case of a lawsuit, but knowing what needs to be kept where and for how long and who can see it can be kind of tricky. Let’s take a minute to go over the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 1.14em;"&gt;What goes into an employee personnel file?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="two" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;While most states define “personnel files” loosely and the contents of a file can differ based on industry, personnel files typically consist of documents which are related to “an employee’s qualifications for employment, promotion, transfer, additional compensation, discharge, or other disciplinary action.” A few items that should be kept in the file are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Employee personnel files can be a hassle! " src="/sites/default/files/book_logos/personnelfiles.jpg" style="width: 440px; height: 285px; float: right;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="two"&gt;&lt;li&gt;employment applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;performance evaluation forms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discipline records&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;signed handbook acknowledgments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tax forms, such as W-4s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pay information, such as raises or cuts. (Note: not payroll records, those should be maintained separately.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="two" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;Your state may have additional regulations on what needs to be included in a personnel files, so make sure to consult your Human Resources Manual on &lt;a href="https://hrsimple.com/user"&gt;hrsimple.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="two"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should be kept separately?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 class="three"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p class="three" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;Generally, all medical records should be kept confidential and stored apart from personnel files. Medical information can be obtained for various employment related reasons and should be maintained accurately and securely in case of an investigation. Some examples of medical information include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="three"&gt;&lt;li&gt;requests for FMLA leave&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;workers’ compensation claims&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;drug testing results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;notes from physicians concerning absences due to illness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;insurance benefits forms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h5 class="three"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immigration forms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p class="three" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;While employers are required to retain employee I-9 forms for a period of three years from the date of hire, or one year after employment is terminated, they should be kept separate from a personnel file. Keeping I-9 Forms out of personnel files insures a certain amount of protection in the case of a government investigation, in that some employment information could suggest discrimination on the employer’s part and would be better if not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 class="three"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Payroll records&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p class="three" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;Keeping an accurate record of who was paid how much and when is extremely important for tax reasons and in case of an audit or investigation, but these records should be kept outside of personnel information. As with immigration forms, a discrimination claim may arise if personnel information is released during an investigation into a company’s pay history, so it is wise to keep this information separate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="two"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who should be given access?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="two" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;A common issue with personnel files is whether to give your employees access to their own file or not. Some employees may be upset if they see the sensitive information contained in their files – such as discipline notes and pay information. On the other hand, not granting them access could hurt employee relations. Additionally, several states have laws on whether to grant employees access or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="two" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;Where should you start? Check your state laws on personnel files &lt;a href="https://hrsimple.com/hrsimple-basic-states/272"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Then use your Model Policies and Forms guide to develop a policy outlining what access your employees have. And, as always, make sure to enforce the policy uniformly, and keep employee personnel files well maintained, safe, and confidential.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/employment-interviews"&gt;Interview Questions: Do&#039;s and Don&#039;ts &lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;Interviews are a key part of the hiring process, but asking the wrong questions can land you in hot water with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Interviews give employers the opportunity to get a feel for an applicant, and they give the applicant a chance to showcase traits that aren’t easily expressed on a résumé. While many employers know the areas they need to cover in the interview (experience, salary, company culture for example), they might not know there are several topics that should be avoided. Seemingly innocent questions, or even natural conversation, may lead an applicant to reveal information about themselves that could open employers up for discrimination claims. Here are a few examples of questions employers should avoid during interviews:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Some questions should not be part of employment interviews." src="/sites/default/files/book_logos/interviewingquestion.jpg" style="width: 360px; height: 323px; float: left; margin: 6px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p class="two"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who should we notify in case of an emergency?&lt;/strong&gt; Once an applicant is hired, it is common practice to ask for emergency contact information, but in the hiring stage it could disclose a number of inappropriate responses, such as marital status, or even sexual orientation. Best to leave this till after a hiring decision has been made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p class="two" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How old are you? &lt;/strong&gt;While applicants will disclose their age and birthday if hired, asking this question during an interview might elicit a age discrimination claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style="list-style-type:circle;"&gt;&lt;li class="no-bullet" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;
&lt;p class="two" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;Related off-limit questions: What year did you graduate? When is your birthday?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p class="two" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you ever been arrested?&lt;/strong&gt; This seems innocent enough – you want to make sure they aren’t hiring someone with a criminal background, but legally employers can only ask if the applicant has been &lt;em&gt;convicted &lt;/em&gt;of a crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p class="two"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What clubs and organizations do you belong to? &lt;/strong&gt;Again, this question seems easy, and relevant to an applicant’s qualifications but might lead to topics like religion or national origin, for example an applicant might respond “I serve as a youth minister at my church.” Instead, employers can ask “Have you ever held a leadership position that might be relevant to the position?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p class="two" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you prefer to be called Miss or Mrs.&lt;/strong&gt;? While asking this question may seem like the polite thing to do, it would reveal an applicant’s marital status, which is irrelevant to their being qualified for a job, and is off limits during the hiring process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="two no-bullet" style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;Related off-limit questions: What does your spouse do for a living? How long have you been married? What is your maiden name?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p class="two" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where were you born? &lt;/strong&gt;Questions about birthplace often times naturally work their way into conversation, but could lead to national origin or even religious discrimination claims. Employers should only ask if the applicant has the legal right to work in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="no-bullet" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;
&lt;p class="two no-bullet" style="font-weight:normal;font-weight:normal;"&gt;Related off&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;limit questions: What is your lineage? Are you of __________ descent?  Where were your parents born?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="two" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;Avoiding these questions ­­­– and any that directly refer to age, sex, race, national origin, or disability – is a good way to steer clear of discrimination charges. Some employers find it helpful even to jot down topics to avoid when making a list of interview questions. Now that you know what questions not to ask, you can get to work on finding the perfect applicant, and not have to worry about the EEOC knocking on your door. &lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/technology-in-the-workplace"&gt;Technology in the Workplace: Employer Protections in the Age of the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like not that long ago “technology in the workplace” referred to fax machines and floppy discs, but things certainly have changed in the last 10 years. Smart phones, email, and wireless networks have revolutionized the way business is being done, but with these advances in technology come a whole new set of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cellphones in the workplace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="one"&gt;Whether it is communicating with employees via company issued smartphones or dealing with a secretary who just won’t stop texting, cellphones are impacting businesses left and right. Here are a few areas that employers should be looking out for as employees become more and more connected to these devices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="bold noafter" style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Texting and driving&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;img alt="Technology in the workplace can bring up a variety of HR problems. " src="/sites/default/files/book_logos/techtroubles.jpg" style="font-weight: normal; width: 425px; height: 308px; float: right;" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="no-bullet" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;If your employee is texting using a company device (or just texting for work related purposes) while driving and causes an accident, a court can find your business responsible. To avoid such problems, employers should have a “no texting while driving” policy in place, and enforce it strictly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="bold noafter" style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wage hour issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="no-bullet" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;It may seem harmless to text an employee a question after he or she has gone home for the day, but if that employee is nonexempt you may be opening yourself up for an FLSA lost wages claim. To be safe employers should either avoid frequently contacting employees outside of work hours or should make sure that employees record the time spent working outside of the office.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="bold noafter" style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lost productivity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="no-bullet" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;A personal phone call, texting on and off, or even the occasional game of Candy Crush can add up to some serious loss of production, but is it realistic to ban cell phone use all together? While a policy that prohibits personal phone use can hurt moral, and lead to longer breaks, some employers have found that a policy detailing the acceptable limits of phone use can be successful in curbing overuse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BYOD issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="one"&gt;Allowing employees to use their own devices (tablets, laptops, cell phones, etc) in the office, and to connect them to servers and networks, can cut down on technology costs and promotes a collaborative work environment. While there are many upsides to a BYOD policy, it can raise security issues and privacy issues. If you have decided to allow the use of personal devices it is key to implement a clear policy outlying what behavior is allowed/prohibited. Some things to cover in a BYOD policy include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A requirement that passwords be used on all devices that contain company documents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An explanation of what types of devices may be used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A list of apps that aren’t allowed: for example some apps may have weak security or others may allow an employee to conduct illegal downloads over your network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A reminder that the company’s acceptable use policy extends to personal devices, and that some sites are not appropriate for the workplace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employee monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="one"&gt;Staying current with the changing technology can be tricky, but one thing that remains the same is that it is in an employer’s best interest to communicate to employees that any employer owned property (no matter what it is or how it is used) is subject to monitoring.  While most employers don’t feel the need to conduct routine monitoring, it is advisable to obtain signed acknowledgments from employees that when it comes to using company devices they have no expectation to privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="one"&gt;For sample acknowledgment forms and monitoring policies, check your Model Policies and Forms guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="one"&gt;As technology advances employers need to make sure their policies and procedures grow with it – having a policy that doesn’t protect your company would be more embarrassing than having an original iPhone! &lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/employee-handbooks"&gt;Employee handbooks – getting a handle on your policies &lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there may be no state or federal law requiring an employer to have a handbook, there are a number or reasons why they are in an employer’s best interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usefulness&lt;/strong&gt;. It is beneficial for there to be one definitive source on the terms of employment. If an employee ever has a question as to what is acceptable or not, they know where to turn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication&lt;/strong&gt;. An employee handbook gives an employer the opportunity to speak clearly on important issues. Handbooks can be a podium for employers to speak out against issues like sexual harassment, workplace violence, bullying, or drug use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarity&lt;/strong&gt;. Employee handbooks create consistency and uniformity in an environment where many people may be involved in the management process. Uniformly enforcing policies cuts down on discrimination claims by ensuring that all employees are treated equally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protection&lt;/strong&gt;. In the case of a trial, jurors have been found to favor companies that have clearly communicated and enforced company policies ­– even if the employee didn’t follow them. The fact that the employer has communicated their disapproval shows an act of good faith.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A job worth doing is worth doing well&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A handbook isn’t necessarily a get out of jail free card. Like any tool, if you don’t use your handbook properly it can end up hurting you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep your employee handbook up-to-date. &lt;/strong&gt;If your polices are outdated, they may prove inaccurate and useless. Say you have a policy that only prohibits talking on a cell phone while driving, but doesn’t mention texting. An employee has the right to assume that behavior is permissible, and you might be found at fault if an accident occurs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be sure to avoid promissory language.&lt;/strong&gt; If your handbook discusses specific timelines, creates expectations of benefits, or doesn’t clearly outline that employment is at-will, courts can find that it acts as a binding contract.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t make the handbook into an encyclopedia. &lt;/strong&gt;Outlining how employees should file for unemployment benefits or workers’ compensation claims can do more harm to your business than good. Avoid discussing any internal practices, and just stick to the rules and regulations your employees need to know about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/sites/default/files/employee_handbooks_logo.jpg" style="width: 260px; height: 256px; float: left; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; margin: 2px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where to start&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are any number of policies an employer can chose to include in their handbook, there are a few that are must haves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduction to the handbook/at-will employment statement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equal employment opportunity policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harassment policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Family and medical leave policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conduct policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acknowledgment form&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For downloadable and customizable examples of these policies, see your Model Policies and Forms guide. Happy handbooking! &lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/job-ads"&gt;Job advertisement do’s and don’ts&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding the right person for a job can be tricky. You have to go through resumes, interviews, offer letters, the process can go on and on. A thing most employers don’t realize, is that they can be making costly mistakes from the first step: the job advertisement. A simple paragraph or two written by an employer can open a whole can of legal worms. Here are a few steps to take to make sure your job advertisement isn’t really looking for trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO use a rock solid job description. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="no-bullet" style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;A well-written job description can be a great tool in not only finding the best applicant, but also in defending any discrimination claims or disability issues.  A clear list of responsibilities that was set before an applicant applied will go a long way in proving there was no pretext for not choosing the candidate. Plus a thorough list will attract candidates who most closely fit your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="no-bullet" style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;For job description templates, check out your Model Policies and Forms guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="no-bullet" style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO include an “Equal Opportunity Employer” Statement. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="no-bullet rteindent3" style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;A simple “_________ is an Equal Opportunity Employer” at the end of a job advertisement can make clear that your company means no unintended discrimination and can save you a lot of hassle down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON’T make any promises you don’t intend to keep. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="no-bullet rteindent3" style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;Statements like “pay increase after 6 months” or “weekly bonuses” may be misleading as they don’t mention anything about performance. If these aspects are important to finding the right person for the job, make sure to explain the requirements necessary in attaining them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="no-bullet" style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON’T discriminate ­– even accidentally. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="no-bullet rteindent3" style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;Any mention of age, race, sex, national origin, disability, or religion is a major job ad no-no. Often, employers make discriminatory statements without even realizing. Phrases like “seeking recent college graduates” or “young and energetic” can be examples of age discrimination. Similarly, attributes such as “a clear speaking voice” can exclude minorities or persons with disabilities. A better practice is to state job responsibilities, such as: “will be responsible for office IT” or “Answer phones and help callers as necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO use online-only applications wisely. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="no-bullet rteindent3" style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;If a position that doesn’t require use of computers only accepts online applications, an employer opens themselves up for claims of disparate impact or discrimination as the ad would leave out lower income applicants. In these cases an employer could also run ads in other media (such as newspapers) or allow applicants to respond via telephone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure to check your ads for these few topics and get to the task at hand: hiring the (hopefully smartest, funniest, responsible, most qualified) new member of your team! &lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/firing"&gt;Firing, a job to do right the first time&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You’re fired." On &lt;em&gt;The Apprentice&lt;/em&gt;, Donald Trump made it look so easy! For the rest of us, a poorly done termination could be costly. Emotions run high, there is a lot of paperwork involved, and an employer can end up with a big mess on their hands. Taking the time to do a termination properly can keep an employer out off court, so here are a few best practices to consider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give the employee the chance to speak.&lt;/strong&gt; In terminations, as in most things, people like to feel like they are being heard. Letting an employee let off steam or plead their case can be enough to avoid further issues. Take a few minutes to chat about the reasons behind the termination, but make sure to listen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get a reference release.&lt;/strong&gt; Type up the basic facts of employment that would be given if a future prospective employer were to call looking for a reference down the line. Have the employee sign to avoid any future confusion or possible defamation accusations. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determine how the final paycheck will be given.&lt;/strong&gt; Some states require final pay to be given within a certain amount of time, a few even require it be given immediately. &lt;a href="https://hrsimple.com/hrsimple-basic/277"&gt;Check this chart&lt;/a&gt; to see what your state requires. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explain how the employee can arrange to receive benefits&lt;/strong&gt;, if any, including COBRA continuation coverage.  Provide proper documents when applicable. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider having the employee sign a release form. &lt;/strong&gt;Having an employee sign a brief explanation of the reasons behind the termination and explaining that they understand any non-compete agreements or waivers of rights can be extremely useful to employers in the case of litigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While firing is probably not your favorite HR task (at least I hope it isn’t!), it is something that comes up now and again. Take the time to terminate correctly, otherwise you might have to fire someone twice…talk about awkward!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sat down with &lt;a href="https://hrsimple.com/partners/authors/kathy-speaker-macnett"&gt;Kathy Speaker MacNett&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;a href="https://hrsimple.com/resources/model-policies-and-forms-pennsylvania-employers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Model Policies and Forms for Pennsylvania Employers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and attorney at &lt;a href="http://skarlatoszonarich.com"&gt;Skarlatos Zonarich&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Tell us about Skarlatos Zonarich:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SkarlatosZonarich LLC is a law firm, which offers clients a wide array of services in the civil arena, including will preparation, estate administration and planning, elder law, labor/employment law (management side), civil litigation, real estate, personal injury and corporate and business services, including exit planning and sales and purchases of businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Who works on &lt;em&gt;Model Policies and Forms for Pennsylvania Employers&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After  I review policies with assistance from other partners and associates at our firm, my paralegal/assistant, Beth Warner, provides the heavy lifting that allows us to publish the “book.” Additionally, we are so happy that Ed Wodarczyk, lends his expertise to writing the benefit portion of the book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. How do you think &lt;em&gt;Model Policies and Forms for Pennsylvania Employers&lt;/em&gt; benefits readers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only last weekend, several folks volunteered how helpful the book was to them because it compiled so many policies, procedures and forms in one easily accessible place.  I didn’t even solicit the comments!  Additionally, it is nice to be able to consult the “book” to obtain the most recent forms from one centralized source.  Inclusion of cutting edge policies and  understandable commentary also assists employers, especially those without their own HR Departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. What do you think is the biggest issue employers face currently in employment law?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Keeping up with the changes!  Not only to employers have to understand the basics of complicated laws like the Affordable Care Act and wage and hour laws, but they also have to keep track of which forms are expiring in any given year.  For small and medium sized businesses this is a particularly difficult task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Finally, to get to know you better, we want to know: What do you like on your pizza?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first preference is green peppers, mushrooms and sausage.  I don’t understand how folks can eat Hawaiian pizza with ham and pineapple!&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/posting-requirements"&gt;Workplace posting requirements &lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While posting requirements are extremely important in communicating employee rights, they are often a trouble spot for employers. With laws changing regularly, it's difficult to ensure that posters are up-to-date and an employer can easily fall behind. Here is a quick checklist to help make sure your employment posters are the poster-child of perfection!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="rteindent1"&gt;&lt;li class="no-bullet" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;❏ I have all the proper federal posters.&lt;/strong&gt; Here is a list of the seven current, required federal posters with a link to where they can be downloaded:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/minwagebwp.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/fmla.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.osha.gov/Publications/osha3165.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;Job Safety &amp; Health Protection (OSHA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/osdbu/eppac.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;Employee Polygraph Protection Act (EPPA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dol.gov/vets/programs/userra/USERRA_Private.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dol.gov/regs/compliance/posters/disabc.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;Employee Rights for Workers with Disabilities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www1.eeoc.gov/employers/upload/eeoc_self_print_poster.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;Equal Employment Opportunity (EEOC)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;"&gt;Additionally, posters can be purchased for $15 by calling HRSimple at (855) 477-4675.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="no-bullet" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;❏ I post all required state posters.&lt;/strong&gt; All states have at least a required minimum wage poster of their own and most have posters concerning leave and child labor. Check your &lt;em&gt;Model Policies and Forms&lt;/em&gt; Guide’s Posting Requirements appendix for a complete list and samples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="no-bullet" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;❏ I have checked to see if my industry has required posters.&lt;/strong&gt; Some industries, such as construction or agriculture, have specific required posters. Employers should check with their State’s Department of Labor for more information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="no-bullet" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;❏ My posters are up-to-date.&lt;/strong&gt; Having an out-of-date poster doesn't do you much good and can result in fines, so check regularly to make sure your posters are current. Posters have an effective date in the lower right corner. Here are the current effective dates:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA): July 2009&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA): February 2013&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Job Safety &amp; Health Protection (OSHA): No date, but the most current one has a QR code in the corner (a small black and white symbol)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employee Polygraph Protection Act (EPPA): June 2003&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA): October 2008&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employee Rights for Workers with Disabilities: June 2007&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equal Employment Opportunity (EEOC): November 2009&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="no-bullet" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;❏  I display my posters in a "conspicuous" place.&lt;/strong&gt; This is trickier than most employers realize. All posters most be readily visible to employees, but the EEOC, FMLA, and EPPA poster must be visible to applicants as well (as they are the target audience), so make sure to post those accordingly!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="no-bullet" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;❏ I post in the proper language.&lt;/strong&gt; Several of the posters are available in other languages. While requirements on which languages need to be covered aren’t exactly set in stone, employers should make their best effort to display posters that the majority of their employees can understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employee posting requirements give loads of employers trouble, but they don’t have to – just go through this checklist regularly to avoid making costly poster mistakes! &lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/Tennessee-author-interview"&gt;Interview with attorneys at Wilson Worley PC&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s time to get to know the authors of the &lt;a href="https://hrsimple.com/resource/tennessee-human-resources-manual"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tennessee Human Resources Manual&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the attorneys at &lt;a href="http://www.wwmgs.com/"&gt;Wilson Worley PC&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Tell us about Wilson Worley: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilson Worley PC is a general civil law firm practicing in upper East Tennessee and southwest Virginia since 1951 from offices in Kingsport, Tennessee. We listen to client needs and work to develop long-term relationships. We want to be known for the competence, quality, and skill of our people, and we are looking for ways to evolve the legal practice to be what our clients need today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Who works on the &lt;em&gt;Tennessee Human Resources Manual&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legwork that goes into the Manual is a collaborative effort each year.  We have an Employment Practice group that includes several lawyers, and one of its jobs is to monitor what is happening in employment law, locally and nationally.  We email newsletter updates to our clients, and there is a blog that we maintain with regular posts on practical HR information.  Then, when the time comes, I work with ACCR to update the Manual each year to have the most current information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. How do you think the &lt;em&gt;Tennessee Human Resources Manual&lt;/em&gt; benefits readers? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have heard that the Manual is a good desk reference with broad coverage of many of the common issues that come up in employing people.  It is a great first step for business owners and HR professionals to get their bearings when questions develop.  Of course, we’re always there to help out, but the Manual has saved many a quick call for consultation on a topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. What do you think is the biggest issue employers face currently in employment law? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The environment for employers is evolving—both in regulatory matters and in employee relations.  We think that striking the balance between a culture of compliance while still promoting the in-company dynamic in a way that allows the business to be successful is a challenge.  Some may point to a specific law like FMLA or the Affordable Care Act, but those things impact different employers differently, if at all.  While there are specific changes to the law and new requirements or rulings to monitor, it is navigating this context that is the biggest singular issue—the one that cuts across company size, industries, agencies, and laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Finally, to get to know you better, we want to know: What do you like on your pizza? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red onions and spinach.  The spinach always worked for Popeye, and the onions mean I don’t have to share as many pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/nebraska-interview"&gt;Interview with attorneys at Knudsen Law Firm&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s time to get to know the authors of the &lt;a href="https://hrsimple.com/ne"&gt;Nebraska HR Library&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.knudsenlaw.com/our-team/kevin-r-mcmanaman/"&gt;Kevin R. McManaman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.knudsenlaw.com/our-team/jeanelle-r-lust/"&gt;Jeanelle R. Lust&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.knudsenlaw.com/"&gt;Knudsen Law Firm&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Tell us about Knudsen:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm has been around for about 130 years. Kevin and Jeanelle only &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like they’ve been around that long. We do a lot of work for schools, nursing homes, and Nebraska employers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Who works on the Nebraska HR Library?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin and Jeanelle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. How do you think the Nebraska HR Library benefits readers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to read and easy to understand and Kevin and Jeanelle answer the phone if you don’t understand what they wrote. (We blame poor editing). &lt;em&gt;[Editor's note: No comment.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. What do you think is the biggest issue employers face currently in employment law?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media – Can you fire because of what your employees say about you, for being on it on company time, or for showing things that our inappropriate but done on their own time? Should employers use social media for background checks, promoting opportunities, promoting products, spying on employees? How much time and effort should be spent monitoring this stuff? What do you do when you see your paralegals entered and win a wet t-shirt contest besides congratulate her on the free trip? No seriously what do you do….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Finally, to get to know you better, we want to know: What do you like on your pizza?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeanelle likes Super Supreme. Kevin: Red peppers, Chicken and mushrooms.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/interns"&gt;Internships&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting an intern is easy, right? Put an ad on Craigslist, hire someone who will work for nothing, make them get your coffee, done! Not so fast. The Department of Labor has clearly specified who qualifies as an intern, and employers who throw the title around willy-nilly can face some serious misclassification charges. Before you make the decision to start a paid or unpaid internship, read through these guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make sure an unpaid internship benefits the intern, not the employer. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the real meat-and-potatoes issue behind properly classifying an intern as unpaid. If an intern is clearly there to learn (not to do the work of a regular employee), and has extra supervision (or shadows other employees), they are gaining education and experience and do not need to be paid. If the intern is doing the regular day-to-day work of the employer, has the same supervision as other employees, and in general is benefiting the employer, they must be paid at least minimum wage and overtime for hours worked over 40 per week.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An intern that is hired in place of an employee, is not really an intern. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unpaid interns are not meant to take the place of regular employees and should not be hired to "lighten the load" for a business. As they are there to learn, interns should never take on the full responsibilities of a position or act as a full-time staff member. Providing extra supervision and changing tasks regularly are good ways to keep the internship legitimate.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t make promises. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting a clear timeline for an internship is important, but promising employment after that term ends suggests that the intern is actually an employee under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and must be paid minimum wage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work with educational establishments to offer course credit in exchange for the internship.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the keys to proper unpaid-intern use is that the "intern" must benefit from the position. Many colleges and universities work with businesses to structure internships as educational arrangements, setting up goals and curriculum to accompany the position. If the employer keeps up their side of this arrangement, they shouldn’t have trouble proving they didn’t treat the intern incorrectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As with anything, get it in writing. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the internship, have the intern sign an acknowledgment form, outlining the length of the internship, and what role the intern will play. NOTE: having an “intern” sign a document agreeing to not be paid does not protect an employer from being charged with classifying them incorrectly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these guidelines in mind, legally employing an intern should be a breeze – but maybe go easy on them when it comes to Starbucks runs! &lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/performance-evaluation"&gt;Performance evaluations&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although they can be a bit uncomfortable for both you and the employee, evaluations serve as an important part of reviewing staff performance and making sure a business runs smoothly. Here are a few answers to some common performance review questions. You can call it a performance review, evaluation or just a check-in...just make sure you do it right!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why should I evaluate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There are a few reasons performance evaluations benefit employers. First of all, and most obviously, evaluations are a great opportunity to have an honest and open dialogue with employees about their work. While some people get uncomfortable or upset by criticism, having a set time when the employee can prepare themselves for feedback helps the conversation run a bit more smoothly. Evaluations also encourage employers to focus on each worker individually, and can be a good tool to keep tabs on growth and output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, performance evaluations can be a valuable tool in the litigation context.  An evaluation that creates a record of an employee’s performance can help to build an excellent defense to an employment discrimination lawsuit. As with everything in HR, documentation is key, and evaluations create a paper trail of warnings, discipline, and criticisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How should evaluations be conducted?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The key to a useful evaluation is training the evaluators correctly. Evaluators should be taught a few main points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be honest. Often times evaluators are afraid to be truthful about how an employee is performing and give higher marks than are deserved. This not only sends the wrong message about what work quality is expected, but also could create confusion down the road should the employee sue for wrongful termination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know how to handle an evaluation that goes poorly. Emotions can run high during evaluations as employees can feel attacked. A good evaluator should know how to keep the mood stable and deal with problems as they arise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be specific and prepared. A good evaluator goes into the evaluation with concrete examples of good and poor work. Some find it useful to review the employee's job description beforehand as a clear list of what is expected from the employee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluate uniformly. Make sure all evaluators are on the same page when it comes to what evaluation terms mean, and how they are applied. Also, use the same process for each evaluation. Using the same forms and ranking systems for each employee helps to avoid any discrimination charges. Check your &lt;a href="http://www.hrsimple.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Model Policies and Forms Guide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for sample evaluation forms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens after the evaluation? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the evaluation is finished, submit a copy to the employee and have them review it, then sign it. This prevents the employee from claiming they didn’t understand the criteria or results of the evaluation.  It also can provide proof of fairness, evidence that the employer has engaged in an interactive process with the employee, and can potentially alert the employer to additional problems with the employee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the employee has signed off on the results, the review should be retained permanently and securely. It is important to keep performance reviews for each employee together so they can be reviewed as a whole and show a clear history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ready? Set? Review! &lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/social-media"&gt;Social media and employment: When Facebook meets 9-to-5&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media, or the process of interacting and sharing ideas in a virtual setting, has exploded over the past 5 years. The popularity of sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram is unquestionable. But how does this new mode of communicating impact employment? Probably in more ways than most employers realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="one"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the hiring process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="one"&gt;If there was a way to know more about an applicant's demeanor, tastes, and personality without asking them, you would do it right? That thought has led many employers to Googling potential hires, a practice with some clear benefits to employers, but also with some dangers that may be less obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is no law prohibiting an employer from viewing publicly available information, it is illegal to make employment decisions based on the protected, personal characteristics of an employee, including race, age, marital status, disability, or religion, all information an employer can be exposed to when investigating social media.   For example, reviewing a job applicant’s Facebook page may reveal that the applicant is disabled, information that might not be known to the employer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this mean an employer should not use social media to investigate applicants? Not necessarily. Employers can have a third party, who is not in charge of making the decision to hire, report to them on any issues found in an employee's Internet presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employee social media rights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) primarily applies to unionized employees, there are some protections under the Act’s Section 7 that give non-unionized employees rights concerning social media. Section 7 protects the concerted activity of employees relating to the terms and conditions of employment. In the last few years the courts have found this protection to cover employee use of social media as a platform to discuss employment issues. Which is all a fancy way of saying “you can’t discipline or terminate an employee for discussing work related issues online.” For example, if one employee posts on their Twitter that it is unfair they have to work a double shift while other employees do not, they are protected under Section 7 and can’t be punished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limiting what employees can and cannot say&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While employers can’t stop employees from participating in social media, they can enact policies to outline what use is acceptable. In general employers should use policies that ban employees from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;disclosing confidential or sensitive company information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;behaving in a way that would violate the company’s anti-discrimination or harassment policies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;making obscene or physically threatening comments about co-workers, customers, vendors, suppliers, and members of management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;using any language, or use of company logos, that suggests the employee is representing the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, employers should make sure to enforce these policies evenly and document any actions taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the clock use of social media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent survey shows that over 20% of employees admit to using social media during working hours, and those are just the ones who were being honest! This practice poses a lot of issues for an employer, with loss of productivity possibly being the biggest. With the prevalence of smart phones and tablets, banning social media use in the office can be difficult. Employers may chose instead to install a policy geared at keeping the use reasonable. Here is an example of a policy which gives the employer the right to determine what use of social media is acceptable during work hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="rtecenter"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="350" scrolling="no" src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=606365A5ED9CC209&amp;resid=606365A5ED9CC209%21690&amp;authkey=ABcwsoYYR-_rzfA&amp;em=2" width="650"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the use of social media among all demographics constantly rising, employers should be sure to protect themselves against these common trouble areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div id="_com_1" uage="JavaScript"&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/telecommuting"&gt;Telecommuting: more than just employees working in their pajamas &lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the advances in technology in the last 20 years, the need for some employees to commute to the office daily has dropped drastically. Telecommuting, or working outside the office (usually in the employee’s home), has become a popular arrangement as it offers some clear advantages for employees and employers, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;increased productivity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increased job satisfaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reduced absenteeism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lower employee turnover&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;savings in expenses such as office rental, utilities, and employee parking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improved employee morale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reduced employee stress and related medical expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not all employees and positions translate well to this digital office, and there are many details to be considered when starting a telecommuting arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What positions are a good fit for telecommuting? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many jobs are easily adaptable for telecommuting, for example: journalist, designer, writer, accountant, data entry, programmer, and data analyst. In general jobs that have a clear production schedule are good for telecommuting as the employee knows how productive they need to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good test is to consider if an employee can close their office door for eight hours and accomplish their job with no face-to-face contact (emailing is allowed), if so that job is adaptable for telecommuting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand there are many jobs in which telecommuting would be a bad match. Roles that involve a lot of managing projects and employees, technology assistance, conducting on site meetings, or that require a lot of face to face contact with team members may not fit the requirements for full-time telecommuting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What employees make successful telecommuters? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An employee’s position being well suited for telecommuting does not necessarily mean the employee is. A good candidate for telecommuting: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;is interested in telecommuting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is self-motivated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has received successful performance evaluations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can function without direct supervision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can work in isolation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has good time management skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can provide an appropriate work space at home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can stay in contact with supervisors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can plan their work according to designated timetables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general employees who have proven themselves to be focused, responsive to supervisors, and otherwise responsible should make good telecommuters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How should an employer start a telecommuting arrangement?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good first step is to sit down with the employee and their supervisor to map out how the telecommuting will be handled. A few topics to discuss are: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;how files and assignments will be shared&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how often check-ins are required &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what equipment will be needed, what will be supplied by the employer, and how such equipment will be maintained&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what workload/time table the telecommuter is responsible for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a reminder that telecommuting is an extension of the office itself, and the employee needs to follow company policies accordingly. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The employer should also remember that they are still responsible for the employee during working hours, and should make arrangements to ensure the employee is working in a safe environment (for example, there are no fire hazards or exposed wires, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the supervisor and employee have discussed the terms of the arrangement, the employee should sign a telecommuting agreement, confirming they have understood the guidelines clearly. Here is an example of such an agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2 align="center" class="forms-heading"&gt;Employer/telecommuter written agreement checklist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul class="one"&gt;&lt;li&gt;The employee will be covered by the employer’s workers’ compensation coverage when at home, if the employee is injured while performing job duties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The employee is required to hold any client or business meetings at the official work office, and not at home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The employer will not be responsible for the cost of utilities other than those specifically agreed upon such as the cost of additional telephone lines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The employee will obtain a fire and safety inspection of the home worksite before telecommuting begins. (Employee must use a UL approved surge protector, and a grounded outlet for telecommuting equipment.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The employer will provide itemized pieces of equipment and any necessary upgrades to the equipment as determined by the employer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The employee will be responsible for securing, with a lock or other security device, the telecommunications equipment provided by the employer, and will be responsible for any damages to the equipment which are the result of failure to secure. The employee will also be responsible for the safeguarding of records, files, correspondence, and other business papers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The employee will be responsible for regular backup and maintenance of computerized files, unless a network system of routine back-up is provided.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The employer has the right to inspect the home worksite, with adequate notice, to ensure that the equipment is being properly maintained. Visits should be scheduled in advance during normal business hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;­_______________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employee signature&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;________________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manager signature&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/dress-codes"&gt;Dress Codes: Who, What, Wear&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As an HR representative or business owner it’s your responsibility to make sure things run smoothly, and sometimes that means enforcing rules or standards that your employees may not want to follow. Dress codes and appearance guidelines are a good way for employers to not only ensure their workforce looks professional to customers and clients, but also can help avoid harassment claims and disciplinary problems.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to drafting an effective dress policy there are a few things employers should be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setting understandable guidelines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A common error in drafting dress codes is to make the language too broad and open-ended, which results in a policy that is hard to follow and to enforce. For example: phrases like “business casual” and “professional attire” don’t clearly outline what an employee can and cannot wear. Instead use specific terms and be clear what is acceptable and unacceptable. Use phrases like “no blue jeans” or “skirts and dresses must reach knee-length.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making those guidelines reasonable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While it is advisable to err on the conservative side, an overly strict dress code can hurt employee morale. When drafting your policy try to keep in mind what is reasonable and necessary for your office.  For example, flip-flops may not be acceptable in a traditional law firm, but they may be acceptable in other environments. Making a policy that is unreasonably strict is also harder to enforce and may result in disciplinary complications.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoiding discrimination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When instituting a dress code employers should be mindful to avoid requirements that might interfere with an employee’s religious beliefs or result in a desperate impact. For example: some religions mandate wearing head coverings and a “no hat” policy may violate those practices. Employers should include a provision in a policy that accommodations can be made for religious beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making a safe work environment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
One aspect of dress codes that employers often overlook is the inclusion of any clothing or gear requirements that could result in a safer workplace. Requiring employees to wear closed-toe shoes, banning dangling jewelry, or specifying what type of eye wear is allowed can result in fewer injuries around the office and should be covered in a dress code policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enforcing evenly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It is key to enforce your dress code policy evenly to avoid discrimination claims. While this is a good rule to follow with all policies it is one that is easily overlooked in regards to appearance. If you are going to reprimand an employee for being scantily clad, you must also discipline an employee who breaks your “no blue jeans” rule, although they seem like disproportionate offenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is a dress code template that you can customize to fit your needs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center" class="policy"&gt;THIS POLICY IS OPTIONAL &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;Dress Code Policy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 1. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;General Rule&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;  Employees’ personal appearance and hygiene are important both to Employees and the Company.  Employees are expected to maintain a good personal appearance and to give consideration to neatness and cleanliness.  Employees should always dress in a manner befitting the job, with due consideration to the needs of the Company, other Employees, and safety.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 2. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Clothing Requirements.&lt;/u&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; An Employee’s clothing should always be in keeping with customary acceptable attire for the [*workplace, *an office, *work, *and meeting with customers, clients, and the public.]  Clothing that is not allowed to be worn by Employees while working includes, but is not limited to, the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;tattered jeans or shorts &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shirts with language or graphics that are vulgar, sexually explicit, or may otherwise be offensive &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;attire that is revealing or provocative &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;flip-flops or any type of loose footwear &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sweat suits &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;see-through blouses or shirts &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hairnets (unless worn around a food operation or clean room) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sports bras, halter tops, or similar attire &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tank tops &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clothing that allows bare midriffs &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;open-toed shoes &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;loose clothing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Section 3. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jewelry/Tattoos/Piercings.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Jewelry must be kept to a minimum.  Tattoos and body piercings may not be visible in work attire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 4. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Accommodation.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; In the event that the above policy causes religious concerns or concerns based upon any other legally protected class, please contact the Human Resource Department to discuss an appropriate religious accommodation. &lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/birthdays"&gt;Birthdays in the workplace&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It only happens once a year and some people think it should be a federal holiday – no, not National Grilled Cheese Day – birthdays!  While some employees could not care less about celebrating them in the workplace or any place else, others will pout all day if you ignore it. But what place do celebrations have in the workplace?  Is it appropriate?  A breach of privacy?  A really good excuse to eat a lot of cake? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few steps to follow to make your office a happy birthday zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step one: Gather the data. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In the hiring paperwork for new employees (NOT for potential employees – so not on an application!) include a quick questionnaire about birthdays, including questions like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are you comfortable with the company acknowledging your birthday?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If so, when is your birthday/birth month?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have any dessert preferences or food allergies?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These questions let you know up front whether an employee prefers to celebrate or not, as many people feel uncomfortable with the attention, and also make sure you are aware of any potential safety issues – marzipan cake isn’t great for those with nut allergies, it turns out.  If an employee chooses not to acknowledge their birthday in the workplace, respect this decision. If you think it might just be shyness and disregard their wishes, you could run into religious discrimination claims as some religions forbid such celebrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step two: Come up with a consistent practice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Set a policy on how birthdays will be celebrated in the workplace. Here are a few options employers have used (keep in mind your company size when picking a policy):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a personal treat and card on or near each employee’s birthday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a cake for the whole office to share during break&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allowing the employee to decide where lunch should be purchased on their birthday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a monthly celebration for all birthdays that month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all things employment related, consistency is key. Celebrating one employee’s birthday more than another’s might lead to hurt feelings, awkward situations, and even discrimination suits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step three: Be careful of the language you use. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem silly to some, but using language like “over the hill” or other age-related jokes could open an employer up for future discrimination charges.  Acknowledging that an employee is older than the rest of the staff and suggesting that to be a negative can be used as evidence in a claim against you.  Alternatively, an employer shouldn’t make observations about an employee being “fresh” or too young. In short, keep the age jokes out of it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these procedures in place, you’ll be able to have your cake, and your employees’ too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need a place to start?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a sample policy you can adjust to suit your birthday practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 align="center" class="sample-title"&gt;SAMPLE BIRTHDAYS IN THE WORKPLACE POLICY&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company recognizes the importance of birthdays as a milestone in one’s life, and the interest of some of its employees in celebrating their co-workers’ birthdays.  Company also recognizes, however, that some people do not wish to have their birthdays publicly celebrated.  To balance these interests, Company introduces the following policy regarding birthdays in the workplace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Company will arrange and pay for a birthday party each month to celebrate the birthdays of those employees whose birthdays fall in that month.  The party will occur at a time and date that is least disruptive to the company, at the Company’s discretion.  Company will provide a cake, healthy snack options, and nonalcoholic beverages under a pre-set budget.  The party is optional for all employees, and employees with birthdays who do not wish to participate are not obligated to attend.  Employees who do not wish to be recognized at the monthly birthday party should request to have their name associated with the monthly birthday party, either by contacting their immediate supervisor or HR.                   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Private, employee-organized birthday celebrations for individual employees may not occur on Company property or during working hours at any time.  Employees are encouraged to be sensitive about excluding co-workers from private birthday celebrations.  Expenditures for private birthday parties are considered to be of a personal nature and will not be reimbursed.                                                   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under no circumstances will Company, its HR staff or managers/supervisors reveal an employee’s age or birth date.  Company expressly forbids employees from teasing co-workers or supervisors about their age at or near the time of an employee’s birthday or during the Company-sponsored monthly birthday celebration. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employees are encouraged to refrain from providing birthday cards with a religious, sexual, or other theme that may be offensive to the person receiving the birthday card.  Remember: What may be humorous or well-intentioned to you may not be so well-received by another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/employment-references"&gt;Employment references&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding new employees can be stressful. Sure, an applicant will say they are a hardworking overachiever, but are they being honest? That's where reference checks come in. For most positions, it is beneficial for an employer to request and contact previous employers to check on perspective employees as it can protect the employer in any future negligent hiring claims. But what is the right way to get a reference? And what is the right way to give a reference for your own past employees?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before conducting the check&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is no law requiring so, an employer should protect themselves by having the applicant sign a broad release before conducting any reference checks. Additionally, employers may be more willing to share information if such a waiver is in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure to have a completed application on hand so you can confirm dates of employment and title to make sure the applicant didn't misrepresent themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;During the check&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While employers may be tempted to gossip or poke for more personal information it is best to stick to the facts. When contacting references, prospective employers should request basic information such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;dates of employment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;job duties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;performance assessments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wage history&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discipline record&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tendency for violence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;circumstances surrounding discharge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eligibility for rehire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The questions asked on the reference check should be specifically job-related and designed to obtain objective information regarding the applicant’s prior job performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While employers may not want to share some of this information, employers should make inquiries and take notes in case a negligent hiring claim is brought against them in the future.  If the former employer will only provide you with name, former position, and dates of employment, ask if they would rehire the applicant, after all that is the best reference an employer can give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When giving references&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employers may choose to adopt a policy of providing only “name, rank, and serial number” information about former employees.  Under such a policy, employers should decline to volunteer any subjective or undocumented information and provide only the dates of employment and the positions held by the employee to avoid claims of defamation, slander, breach of privacy, or retaliation. Truth is the best defense to any of these claims, so only provide factual, supportable  information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some employers find it helpful to give references in writing to avoid disclosing too much information. In this case employers should use the same form for each reference given, and stick to the information requested. Such forms can be emailed and then retained in the employee's file. An example is provided below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, employers should make notes of the reference, who it was given to, when, and what was discussed. This information can be helpful in a future lawsuit, and can be kept in the employee's file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2 class="forms-heading"&gt;employment reference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Name of applicant:______________________________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stated dates of employment:____________________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/bullying"&gt;Bullying in the workplace&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago if you heard the word bullying, images of playgrounds and principals' offices might come to mind. It's true that many people felt that bullying only applied to children, but in recent years we've acknowledged the truth of the situation: adults can be bullied – and bullies – too. A 2010 survey showed that over 35% of adults admit to being bullied and another 15% admit to witnessing bullying. With these numbers on the rise, employers need to learn to identify and prevent bullying in the workplace, as it can lead to some very serious problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is bullying a workplace issue?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Aside from wanting to provide a safe, healthy environment for employees, employers should be concerned about bullying for a few reasons. Typically bullying leads to a breakdown in communication between staff members, and can seriously impact productivity. Who would want to work alongside someone that was picking on them? In addition to loss of production, bullying can lead to claims of harassment, discrimination, and can result in violence. These very real issues for employers can even result in lawsuits or fines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is bullying?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Like many workplace issues, bullying can take many shapes. The common definition of bullying is any abusive conduct committed by an individual or group against another. While that explanation is vague, it is helpful as a general way to measure appropriate behavior. In the workplace this behavior can manifest in a number of ways, such as yelling, insults, and disrespecting private space. This form of bullying is usually easier to identify and discipline, but bullying can also be a lot more subtle. Other forms of bullying can include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-ce1a7f7e-163c-d427-2616-87c3219081ab"&gt;isolating employees&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-ce1a7f7e-163c-d427-2616-87c3219081ab"&gt;routinely taking credit for other’s work&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-ce1a7f7e-163c-d427-2616-87c3219081ab"&gt;imposing unrealistic deadlines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-ce1a7f7e-163c-d427-2616-87c3219081ab"&gt;unnecessarily criticizing the work of an employee. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-ce1a7f7e-163c-d427-2616-87c3219081ab"&gt;In the case of supervisors, being harder on one employee than others can be construed not only as unfair treatment but an act of bullying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can employers prevent bullying?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The first step in preventing bullying is to implement a clear anti-bullying policy. A few things to include in such a policy are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-ce1a7f7e-163c-d427-2616-87c3219081ab"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A clear definition of what conduct is considered bullying&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Employers should outline exactly what behavior is unacceptable in no uncertain terms. It is also wise to add that management will make any decisions about what is and is not bullying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-ce1a7f7e-163c-d427-2616-87c3219081ab"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A reporting procedure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Include instructions as to how employees can report being bullied or bullying they have witnessed. Include to whom reports should be made and if they can be made anonymously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-ce1a7f7e-163c-d427-2616-87c3219081ab"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A non-retaliation clause&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Employees should feel safe to report bullying without fear of punishment.  A few sentences explaining that any employee who comes forward with such information will be protected can go a long way in putting employees at easy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p style="margin-left:3pt;"&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-ce1a7f7e-163c-d427-2616-87c3219081ab"&gt;Find an example of an anti-bullying policy below. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:3pt;"&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-ce1a7f7e-163c-d427-2616-87c3219081ab"&gt;Aside from instituting a no bullying policy, employers should also consider requiring specialized training for employees to help them understand bullying. Similar trainings to prevent other negative workplace behaviors (like harassment) are a common and effective HR tool.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally employers and managers should make a firm commitment to avoid participating in any form of bullying. Employees can be more sensitive to the actions of those in roles of leadership and, as such, employers and supervisors have a bigger responsibility to treat each employee with respect and sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center" class="policy"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em;"&gt;SAMPLE POLICY  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-ce1a7f7e-163c-d427-2616-87c3219081ab"&gt;Bullying is harmful to the employees of ABC Company, resulting in reduced productivity, efficiency and morale, and increased absenteeism and turnover.  In providing a productive working environment, ABC Company believes that its employees should be able to enjoy a workplace free from all forms of bullying conduct.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-ce1a7f7e-163c-d427-2616-87c3219081ab"&gt;It is against the policy of the Company for any employee, whether a manager, supervisor, or co-worker, to bully another employee.  This policy applies to all company activities and events, as well as publically accessible off-duty activities including social media.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-ce1a7f7e-163c-d427-2616-87c3219081ab"&gt;Prohibited bullying occurs whenever there is severe, repeated mistreatment that targets one or more persons which, through verbal abuse, offensive conduct, or interference, that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment; interferes with a person’s work performance; or otherwise adversely affects a person’s employment opportunities with the Company.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-ce1a7f7e-163c-d427-2616-87c3219081ab"&gt;Bullying conduct could include, but is not limited to, repeated and aggressive: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-ce1a7f7e-163c-d427-2616-87c3219081ab"&gt;Teasing, name-calling, slandering, ridiculing, maligning, a person or his/her family &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-ce1a7f7e-163c-d427-2616-87c3219081ab"&gt;Screaming, shouting, yelling, or swearing at another in public or private &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-ce1a7f7e-163c-d427-2616-87c3219081ab"&gt;Persistent phone calls, voicemails, emails, or postings to or about another person &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-ce1a7f7e-163c-d427-2616-87c3219081ab"&gt;Unreasonable public criticism, reprimands, or trivializing of another’s work &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-ce1a7f7e-163c-d427-2616-87c3219081ab"&gt;Excluding others from meetings or social situations, or giving the “silent treatment” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-ce1a7f7e-163c-d427-2616-87c3219081ab"&gt;Destructive gossip, rumors or innuendo &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-ce1a7f7e-163c-d427-2616-87c3219081ab"&gt;Physical pushing, shoving, throwing things &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-ce1a7f7e-163c-d427-2616-87c3219081ab"&gt;Non-verbal threatening gestures or glances, staring or glaring &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-ce1a7f7e-163c-d427-2616-87c3219081ab"&gt;Intentional interference with another’s work, for example, through impossible deadlines, supplying insufficient or incorrect resources or information.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-ce1a7f7e-163c-d427-2616-87c3219081ab"&gt;Evaluative work performance comments by one’s supervisor relating to deficiencies, constructive feedback, and counseling are appropriate and reasonable and do not constitute bullying behavior.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-ce1a7f7e-163c-d427-2616-87c3219081ab"&gt;Any employee who believes he or she has been bullied in violation of this policy should report the conduct immediately to his or her supervisor; or, if that person is responsible for the behavior, to the Human Resources Department. The employee always has the option of reporting the conduct directly to the Human Resources Department if he or she prefers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-ce1a7f7e-163c-d427-2616-87c3219081ab"&gt;A thorough and impartial investigation of all complaints will be conducted in a timely and confidential manner.  Confidentiality will be maintained during the investigation to the extent possible without jeopardizing the thoroughness of the investigation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-ce1a7f7e-163c-d427-2616-87c3219081ab"&gt;Any employee of the Company who has been found, after investigation, to have bullied another employee in violation of this policy will be subject to a required apology, counseling, training and/or disciplinary action up to and including termination. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-ce1a7f7e-163c-d427-2616-87c3219081ab"&gt;Retaliation against the individual reporting the bullying behavior is expressly prohibited.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/holidays"&gt;Holidays&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summer can bring up several employment issues, including discipline and dress code violations, but one of the biggest issues is just getting employees to show up! With holidays and vacations, warmer summer months often result in lower attendance, which can translate to a loss in productivity. Time off requests also pose a lot of administrative problems, and employers should be sure to enforce a clear policy to ensure fairness.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know which days are considered holidays&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in dealing with holidays and time off requests is to identify which days are holidays and if you are required to provide time off for them.   Many states have not enacted laws requiring private employers to provide paid holidays or holiday time off to their employees. Check with your state's department of labor to see what your requirements are.   Most larger private businesses observe the following federal holidays:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;New Year’s Day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. Day (3rd Monday in January)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memorial Day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Independence Day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Labor Day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Veterans’ Day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thanksgiving Day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friday after Thanksgiving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Christmas Day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smaller businesses often only observe the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;New Year’s Day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memorial Day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Independence Day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Labor Day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thanksgiving Day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Christmas Day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employers should decide which of these days will be given off and communicate that decision clearly to employees. They may also elect to pay time and half for such holidays to reward employees for coming to work and to encourage staff to continue business as usual. If employers chose to offer this special wage they should draft a policy that clearly outlines which days will qualify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to include in a policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In drafting a holiday policy, the following topics should be considered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;which employees are eligible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what holidays will be recognized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether holidays will be paid and at what rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conditions for receipt of holiday pay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;treatment of holidays during vacations and leaves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;See an example below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond drafting a policy employers should do their best to treat employee time off requests fairly. While there is something to be said for the "first asked, first given" rule, it is not fair for some employees to be stuck working all holidays. Employers should keep a calendar of days off, and try their best to spread the free time and responsibilities evenly among employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center" class="policy"&gt;THIS POLICY IS OPTIONAL &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 align="center" class="sample-title"&gt;SAMPLE POLICY &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC Company will grant paid holiday time off to all eligible full-time employees.  Regular part‑time employees will receive pay for each designated holiday pro rated based on their normally scheduled hours compared to a regular 40 hour work week.  Holiday pay will be calculated based on the employee’s straight time pay rate as of the date of the holiday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC Company observes the following as paid holidays for regular full-time employees: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•     New Year’s Day                &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•      Memorial Day              &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•     Thanksgiving&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    •     Martin Luther King,           &lt;span style="text-align: -webkit-right;"&gt;Jr. Day &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•      Independence Day        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•     Day After Thanksgiving        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•      Labor Day                     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•     Christmas Day &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A holiday that falls on a weekend will be observed on either the preceding Friday or the following Monday to coincide with local custom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be eligible for holiday pay, an employee must have worked his or her regularly scheduled hours on the workday before and the workday after the holiday, or have been on approved vacation or other paid leave.  If an employee is on vacation/leave when a holiday is observed, the employee will be paid for the holiday and will be granted an alternate day of vacation/leave at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any hourly, non‑exempt employee required to work on a holiday will receive double‑time payment for the hours worked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paid time off for holidays will not be counted as hours worked for purposes of determining overtime. &lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/employment-law-checkup"&gt;Employment law checkup&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work can get a little hectic sometimes. Running from here to there, meeting after meeting, stressing about a thousand different things – it helps to slow down every once in a while to take an inventory. Here are a few areas we think could benefit from a quick checkup. A few minutes of spot checking could save you a big mess down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job descriptions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of the earliest areas an employer can get themselves into trouble during the employment process, job descriptions need to follow a few rules to be effective. Make sure job descriptions are free of discriminatory language, which can be as innocent as something like "seeking a youthful candidate." Descriptions should also clearly and accurately represent all of the job's true responsibilities as they could be referenced during a potential future lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to job descriptions, applications can get sticky for some employers. Making sure to stick to the necessary information is key.  Employment applications should also contain a statement that explains the employer does not discriminate. A simple "[Company] is an Equal Opportunity Employer” can cover a lot of issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance reviews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to reviewing employee performance two aspects are essential: documentation and clarity. Reviews are a great way to give employees helpful feedback, but make sure you are doing it consistently, otherwise the benefits may be lost. Reviews can also demonstrate a history of poor performance, which can give an employer some protection in employment-related lawsuits. So make sure you are you are being thorough and maintaining clear records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hrsimple.com/blog/performance-evaluation"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about performance reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recordkeeping requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you keeping the right things, in the right places, for the right amount of time? Different forms and information need to be kept for certain lengths of time during and after employment – and in sometimes in specific places, as well. Consult the recordkeeping requirements appendix in your &lt;em&gt;Model Policies and Forms&lt;/em&gt; guide for federal and state-specific rules and regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Posting requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way that employers are required to notify their employees of their rights is through employment law posters. In addition to the 6 federal posters, states require posters of their own on varying laws. Additionally, these posters change from time to time, often with little warning. Check the list below to make sure you are using the proper federal posters and check the posting requirements appendix in your &lt;em&gt;Model Policies and Forms&lt;/em&gt; guide for state requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA): July 2009&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA): February 2013&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Job Safety &amp; Health Protection (OSHA): No date, but the most current one has a QR code in the corner (a small black and white symbol)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employee Polygraph Protection Act (EPPA): June 2012&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA): October 2008&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equal Employment Opportunity (EEOC): November 2009&lt;/li&gt;

    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;A recent poll shows that over 40% of Americans have dated a coworker, making the topic of inter-office romance pretty hard to ignore. While you may be glad that your staff is finding happiness, there are several serious issues that can be brought up when employees start dating and employers should be sure to protect themselves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Protecting against harassment &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p4"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;One of the biggest concerns with inter-office relationships is harassment. Employers should have a clear anti-harassment policy in place that outlines what behavior is acceptable and unacceptable. Such policies should clearly state that employees are safe from retaliation if they come forth with any harassment claims. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-fraternization policies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
One option for employers is to completely prohibit relationships at work in order to reduce the risk of sexual harassment and related claims by instituting a "non-fraternization" policy. However, these policies can have negative effects as well. Most likely employees will continue to have relationships and employers won’t have the opportunity to lessen the possible negative results. Also such a strict policy is bad for employee morale as it makes the employer seem overbearing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Subordinates and managers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Office romances are also problematic when an employee in a position of power dates a subordinate. If the relationship sours, allegations of retaliation or harassment could be made. Even if the relationship goes well, other employees may say the supervisor is showing favoritism. Employers should consider a policy against such relationships, or one that requires employees to disclose these relationships and sign agreements for solutions for if the relationship becomes problematic (i.e. one employee would be transferred).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Love contracts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A consensual relationship agreement, sometimes called a love contract, is a written document signed by two employees in a consensual relationship acknowledging the relationship is voluntary.  These disclosures usually contain a reminder of the company's harassment, discrimination, and retaliation policies, as well as a clear acknowledgment that the relationship is consensual. These forms are a good way for employers to remind employees of their policies and protect themselves from future lawsuits.&lt;span class="s2"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p5"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prohibiting inappropriate workplace conduct&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p5"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;No matter your stance on inner-office dating, employers should have policies in place outlawing certain behaviors that can make other employees uncomfortable and lead to harassment charges. Employers should have policies which clearly state:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="p5"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;no overt displays of affection at work, including kissing or hand-holding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p5"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;work communications systems are to be used for work only – no personal email or voice mail using working time or company equipment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p5"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;employees must behave professionally and in a business-like manner while at work or all company functions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p5"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;romantic squabbles should be left outside of the workplace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/form-I-9"&gt;I-9 Form, ins and outs&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know that the I-9 form is an essential part of the hiring process. The form verifies that employees are legally eligible to work in the United States by requiring employees to submit a combination of forms of identification. While most employers know that an I-9 form is required for new employees, there are several aspects of the form that if done improperly can lead to issues. Here are some quick tips to keep your employment eligibility process running smoothly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t be overeager. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;The I-9 form should only be filled out once an employee has been hired. The regulations require Section 1 to be completed on the first day of employment, but employers are permitted three business days to complete the entire form. Requiring applicants to fill out any paperwork concerning citizenship can lead to claims of discrimination and should be avoided. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make sure you are using the right form. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;The form has undergone several changes over the last few years, and employers should be sure they are using the most recent edition, as many employers use copies of the same form without checking for updates. On March 8, 2013, the USCIS released a new, 2-page I-9 form (9 pages total with explanations) with an expiration date of 03/31/2016. This updated form is currently the only acceptable edition and can be downloaded here: &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;www.uscis.gov/files/form/i-9.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow the directions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;There are several instructions about how the form should be filled out that seem small but could result in the I-9 form being rejected. For example: &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;Use black or blue ink on the I-9 Form.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;Do not use different color or type of ink in the same section.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;Do not have more than one handwriting in the same Section (unless person filling out Section 2 is also preparer/translator).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;Do not use pencil.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;Expiration date of documents must be written as month/day/year (do not use day/month/year).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;If a mistake occurs during completion of the form, start over with a new form.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Handle documentation properly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;Section 2 is all about employees submitting the right documents, which are used by the employer to verify identity and work eligibility. An employee must present either:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;an acceptable document from List A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="no-bullet" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;&lt;a&gt;or&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;acceptable documents from both List B and List C.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;While this seems easy enough, many employers get caught making silly mistakes. Here are a few things to watch out for. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;Don’t tell an employee which documents they can and cannot use. Give them the list and let them chose for themselves. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;Don’t fill out more than you need to. If you use a List A document, do not fill out List B and List C documents.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;Do examine the original documents and verify that they appear genuine – making sure the photo or the description of the person reasonably matches the person  showing the documents to you (for example, height, age, race or gender) and that the documents are original and unexpired.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;Do not accept photocopies of documents. Only original documents are acceptable. If the employee cannot produce original documents to complete the I-9 Form, the  employee cannot work at the company.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;Now that you can navigate the choppy seas of employment verification, your I-9 form journeys should be smooth sailing!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/employment-at-will"&gt;Employment at-will&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;When people speak of the employment relationship being employment at-will, that means that the contract between the employer and the employee provides that the employee may resign at any time, for any reason, and the employer may terminate the employee at any time, for any &lt;b&gt;lawful&lt;/b&gt; reason. At-will employment is for an indefinite duration and may be terminated by either the employee or the employer, at any time, with or without notice, with or without cause, for any reason that is not prohibited by law.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Generally, employment is at-will, but establishing and maintaining employment at-will policies can help by discouraging employees and plaintiffs’ attorneys from bringing breach of contract employment claims, reducing the likelihood that the employer will be sued.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Preserving at-will status&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;There are a few things employers can do to maintain the employment at-will relationship, which can protect them from litigation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Require an employment application&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Some companies have gotten away from requiring application forms and, instead, rely on resumes and letters of interest.  While these documents may provide helpful information to the company, they should not be accepted in lieu of a completed application form.  Among other things, applications, when properly drafted, assist the company in preserving its status as an at-will employer by requiring the candidate to acknowledge in writing that all employment with the company is at-will. Including a phrase like the one below at the end of the application can give an employer protection from wrongful termination claims: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; “I understand that, if hired, my employment will be strictly at will.  That means that my employment is for an indefinite period and that the company or I may terminate the employment at any time, for any or no reason, with or without notice or intermediate steps.  I further understand that no verbal statements or statements in any company policy or procedure manual, employee handbook, or other document shall be construed to have altered the at-will nature of my employment.  No company manager or representative shall be authorized to make any representations to the contrary.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Offer letter disclaimer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="no-bullet" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;To avoid the risk of the offer letter jeopardizing the at-will nature of the employment relationship, companies should do two things: &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;refrain from making any reference to the company’s employee handbook, manuals or employment policies &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;include specific at-will disclaimer in the offer letter, such as the following:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“As you may know, all employment with our company is at-will, which means that either you or the company will be free, at any time, with or without notice, to terminate the employment relationship, for any or no &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Handbook/acknowledgement disclaimers &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="no-bullet" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;To minimize the risk of legal liability from employee handbooks or other written policies, employers should include a legally enforceable disclaimer provision in the handbook and acknowledgement form.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other company documents&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="no-bullet" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;A handbook and acknowledgement form disclaimer, even if well-drafted, may not protect the employer if other provisions in the handbook suggest continued employment or termination only for certain occurrences.  To minimize this risk, employers should include an at-will disclaimer in documents that could imply continued employment for a definite period or termination only for certain occurrences.  Examples include annual bonus or commission plans, disciplinary documentation and performance review plans. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="hrsimple.com " src="/sites/default/files/images/screen_shot_2014-04-24_at_12.01.41_pm.png" style="width: 1px; height: 1px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/breaks"&gt;Breaktimes&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Meal breaks and rest breaks continue to be some of the biggest grey areas in employment. Whether its understanding how much time needs to be provided, what limitations an employer can place on the employee during that time, or timekeeping issues, break time can be a very confusing topic. Here are a few things to keep in mind when dealing with employee breaks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The basics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Employers covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) should pay employees for all breaks and meal periods under 30 minutes or for any meals when the employee is not completely relieved of his duties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this seems very straightforward there are often situations in which employee breaks are interrupted and thus should be paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="three" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Example:&lt;br /&gt;
An employee is given an hour meal period and is permitted to leave the premises, but the employee regularly is required to answer his cell phone to field work-related questions during lunch.  The time spent answering/talking on the cell phone is work time.  Further, if the phone calls are frequent enough to not give the employee an uninterrupted break, the employer will have to compensate the employee for the entire meal period.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scheduling the break&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Another issue with break times is knowing at what point they are required. About half of the states have laws requiring breaks at certain hour thresholds, for example after five consecutive hours of work. Check your state’s requirement &lt;a href="https://hrsimple.com/chapter/200/220#Are_meal_periods_compensable"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where the break is taken&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
One misconception is that if the employee is not allowed to leave the premises the break must be paid. For safety reasons, some employers prohibit staff from coming and going from the office during shifts. As long as the employee is fully relieved of their duties, these breaks do not be to be paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Day-long breaks from work&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Some states also have laws requiring rest days after employees have worked a certain number of days. Check with your state’s department of labor for more information. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meal and break time policies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;As with all employment law topics, the best way to stay out of trouble is to have a clear policy in place and to enforce it evenly. Below is an example of an hours of work policy you can customize to fit your needs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="sample-title"&gt;Hours of Work policy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Workweek&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The workweek is Monday through Sunday.  Day (first) shift is from 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.  Evening (second) shift is from 3:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.  Night (third) shift is from 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wash-up Periods&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;A non-exempt employee will receive a paid wash-up period of five minutes immediately before his or her lunch and a paid washup period of five minutes immediately before the end of his or her shift.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Break Periods&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;A non-exempt employee will receive a paid break period of 10 minutes in the first four hours of a shift lasting at least four hours and a paid break period of 10 minutes in the second four hours of a shift lasting at least eight hours.  The Company will continue its practice of offering an unpaid supper period when extended overtime is worked into late evening hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meal Periods&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;A non-exempt employee will receive an unpaid meal period of 30 minutes during a shift lasting more than four hours.  The timing of the meal period for each employee shall be solely at the discretion of the employee’s supervisor.  No work may be performed during the meal period.  If you do perform work during a meal period, you must inform your supervisor immediately, and your timecard must reflect that you worked during the meal period.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/attendance"&gt;Attendance policies&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div class="p1" id="product-page-description" p=""&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Needless to say, a company can’t operate (let alone succeed) if the employees aren’t showing up to work. But how do you ensure that your workforce will consistently report for duty? One good step is having a clear attendance policy. Communicating clearly about what are acceptable reasons to miss work, how these requests should be made, and what does not qualify as an excusable absence can prevent a lot of confusion and make employees more accountable. The key to communicating these guidelines is a well-written and enforced “No-Fault Attendance” policy. This kind of policy may even boost employee morale by minimizing resentment on the part of some employees toward coworkers who suffer no consequences for being chronically absent.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Here is a deeper look at what such a policy should cover.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;General tone &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;An attendance policy should be strict enough to allow the employer to discipline those employees whose absences cause problems, yet flexible enough that the employer does not have to terminate good employees who are absent infrequently. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multiple policies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;It is also acceptable to have different policies for different departments, as the needs for the staff to be present on a daily basis and shift lengths may differ. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Morale&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Rewarding employees for good attendance is good for employee morale and ultimately may improve overall attendance.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interaction with &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;unemployment compensation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;A reasonable and enforced policy is a good defense against unemployment compensation claims if an employer can prove that the employee failed to abide by the published attendance policy.  Such a policy is a good defense to an unemployment compensation claim by an employee terminated for excessive absenteeism as it allows the employer to show that the employee violated the uniformly enforced policy and was discharged for doing so.  Again, to be effective, the policy must be reasonable, uniformly enforced, and in writing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p4"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disabilities and attendance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;In addition, a well-written and uniformly enforced attendance policy may avoid liability under the ADA to job applicants or employees whose disabilities prevent regular and consistent attendance.  The employer’s reasonable attendance standards may be deemed an essential function of the job, which may not have to be relaxed as part of a reasonable accommodation if attendance is required to perform the position and the attendance standards are spelled out in advance and uniformly and consistently applied.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p4"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Family and medical leave absences&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) has made enforcing absentee policies more difficult for larger employers by prohibiting covered employers from disciplining or discharging an eligible employee for an absence caused by a protected reason, including a serious health condition of the employee or a member of his or her family.  The FMLA does impose certain requirements upon employees with respect to eligibility for leave – including notice to the employer and medical certification, and employers should be mindful of enforcing attendance policies in situations that involve FMLA leave. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p6"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Below is an example of an attendance policy that uses a point system for employee absences that you can customize to fit your needs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p6"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="sample-title"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Sample attendance policy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;You are hired to perform an important function at ABC Company.  As with any group effort, it takes cooperation and commitment from everyone to operate effectively.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Therefore, your attendance and punctuality are very important. Absences cause a slow-down in the work and added burdens for your fellow employees.  Good attendance is something that is expected from all employees. You should be at your work station by the start of each workday at the time designated by the department.  Excessive absenteeism or tardiness will not be tolerated and will be cause for disciplinary action up to and including discharge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;We do realize, however, that there are times when absences and tardiness cannot be avoided.  This is why we have a no-fault system that allows you to accumulate some points before any disciplinary action will be taken against you. It is expected that everyone will accumulate some points under this system.  It is only when points become excessive, and warnings are issued, that an employee need be concerned about his or her attendance practices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Regardless of the reason for your absence, you are expected to properly notify your supervisor on duty at least one hour in advance of your scheduled work time.  Leaving a message does not qualify as notifying your supervisor.  You must personally contact your supervisor.  Lack of a telephone or absence from town is not an excuse for failing to notify your supervisor of absence or tardiness.  You should call every day that you are absent unless you are on an approved leave of absence. Unreported and unexcused absences of two consecutive work days will be considered a voluntary resignation of employment with the Company.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Each employee’s absenteeism and tardiness records are kept on file with the Human Resources Department.  The absenteeism and tardiness records are kept on a point system basis.  Depending upon the nature of the absence, a certain number of points are accumulated by an employee on his or her absence record. When an employee reaches various point totals, certain notice and disciplinary actions will be taken.  An employee may receive a written notice, a written warning, a final written warning, or may be discharged depending upon the number of points he or she accumulates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The point system is based upon the progressive past 12 calendar months. Any employee who accumulates 24 or more points in a 12 calendar month period under this system will be discharged.  On the first day of each calendar month, points accumulated during that same month one year prior will be removed from the employee’s record for purposes of this policy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;If an employee accumulates only three points or less during any progressive 12 calendar month period, he or she will receive one day off with pay.  Upon earning a day off with pay, the employee will begin a new 12-month period for purposes of earning another day off under this program.  Absences from work will accumulate points in the following manner:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;If your absence is due to illness or injury, you may be required to provide a doctor’s report supporting the necessity of your absence, as well as your ability to return to your work, within 15 calendar days after the absence or tardiness.  If your absence is the result of personal emergency other than illness or injury, documentation supporting your absence may be required.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;No Points&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    1.    Off work due to a work-related injury with medical verification that the employee is unable to work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    2.    Off work due to jury duty, military leave, medical leave, FMLA leave, lack of work, subpoenas, or any other absence expressly authorized by the Company, the terms of Company policy, or the law.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    3.    Off work because of adverse weather conditions resulting in the closing of schools and/or roads in this or the surrounding counties by the local authorities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    4.    Off work due to an accident in which you are involved coming to work and which you can verify through police records or other satisfactory evidence.  Car trouble is not excused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;One-half (1/2) Point&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    1.    Leaving work early because of a proven emergency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;One (1) Point&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    1.    Late to work by 18 minutes or less for any reason not excused above.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    2.    Leaving work two hours or less before the end of your scheduled work time for any reason not excused above after notifying your supervisor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two (2) Points&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    1.    Late to work by more than 18 minutes for any reason not excused above.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    2.    Leaving work more than two hours before the end of your scheduled workweek for any reason not excused above after notifying your supervisor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Three (3) Points&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    1.     Absence for any reason not excused above with proper call-in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Twelve (12) Points&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    1.     Absence for any reason not excused above without proper call-in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The accumulation of the following number of points will result in the following action being taken by the Company:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    •    12 Points:  A written notice that the employee has accumulated 12 or more points.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    •    16 Points:  A written warning to the employee.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    •    20 Points:  A final written warning to the employee.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    •    24 Points:  The employee will be discharged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;EXAMPLE:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Employee is late on one occasion by 30 minutes, leaves work 1 hour early on another occasion, and has three properly reported absences that are not excused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;2 points + 1 point + 9 points = 12 points = Written Notice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The Company will not notify the employees that through the passage of time they have lost points.  However, each time an employee accumulates enough points to trigger a notice or warning, the employee will receive such notice or warning.  For example, if an employee accumulates 12 points and receives a written notice of such points and then subsequently drops, through the passage of time, to 10 points, the employee will be reissued a written notice again upon the re-accumulation of 12 points.  Employees also may check with the Human Resources Department at any time to determine their point status.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sample-text"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The Company also reserves the right to impose discipline, up to and including discharge, for excessive excused absences or tardiness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/non-compete-agreements"&gt;Non-compete agreements&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;One of the most problematic parts of ending an employment relationship is what happens afterwards. While it is clear that the employee must go in a new direction, there can be some confusion as to what an employer can do to make sure its business interests aren’t negatively impacted. When an employee relocates or goes out on their own they may want to take clients, staff, information or ideas with them, but there are a few things employers can do to safeguard these valuable assets.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-compete agreements&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;One way employers can protect themselves is by having employees sign non-compete agreements –agreements that prohibit the employee from competing with his or her employer during and after termination of employment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Absence of a non-compete agreement, a company’s former employees are free to:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;immediately work for a competitor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;solicit their former employer’s customers and employees&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;disclose confidential information that does not rise to the level of a trade secret. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;There are a few guidelines employers must follow to make these agreements enforceable, and also to protect an employee’s ability to find work post termination.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be reasonable in geographic scope and duration.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p5"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The restrictions must be reasonable as to the length of time and geographic area. Generally, the greatest danger of employees working for the competition happens in the months immediately following termination, therefore non-compete agreements that restrict employment for a period of longer than two years may be declared invalid.  Although not universal, agreements of one year or less are generally held to be acceptable.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Protect a legitimate business concern&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p5"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Restrictions in a non-compete agreement must protect legitimate business concerns in order to be enforceable.  Most states require employers to prove a legitimate business interest that goes beyond merely not wanting to compete with an ex-employee.  The definition of a legitimate business interest that is sufficient to support a non-compete varies, but may include the protection of trade secrets, prevention of an employee’s release of confidential information regarding the employer’s customers, or an employee’s services to the employer that are deemed special or unique. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other factors affecting enforceability&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p5"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Some courts have also looked to other factors, including whether the agreement will essentially prevent the employee from working in his or her chosen field, whether the restriction will cause the employee undue hardship, and whether the employer has enforced non-competes against other employees. In general, enforceability can be judged on what is overall fair to both the employer and employee. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p7"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trade secrets&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;A trade secret is information that derives economic value from being generally unknown to others who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and is the subject of reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy. Trade secrets work hand-in-hand with non-compete agreements to protect employers in that they are the information that is being protected by such agreements. Trade secrets are protected under the laws of every state in the United States.  Even where an employer does not have a written contract with an employee governing the protection of trade secret information, the employer’s trade secrets are protected by statute or under the common law. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p8"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Trade secrets are generally defined as information that: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;is not generally known in an industry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;derives economic value by virtue of its secrecy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;is the subject of secrecy efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Generally, for information to qualify as a trade secret, the employer must make an effort to maintain the secrecy of the information.  Here are a few examples of what employers can do to protect their trade secrets:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;conduct proper background checks on new employees &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;label trade secrets prominently with “confidential” or “proprietary”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;limit distribution of documents to “need to know” or “need to use” personnel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;limit access to computer areas and computer systems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;install screen savers and server passwords to protect computer systems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;place restrictions on photocopying through the use of logs or central photocopying&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;use document destruction systems such as in-house shredding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;conduct exit interviews for every departing employee to make sure that all trade secrets or confidential information remain with the company and to reemphasize the duty of confidentiality to these employees.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="p7"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-compete agreements and trade secrets in hiring&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Most employers think of non-compete agreements and trade secrets as subjects only considered in the context of protecting a company from unfair competition by others.  However, this is a far too narrow view.  Considerations should be made during the hiring process as to whether or not the applicant might be held under any restrictions based upon prior employment.  Not only could such restrictions limit the suitability of the individual for the new job, but could also result in having the new employer dragged into court as a defendant in a claim for unlawfully interfering with the prior employer’s rights.  Care should always be taken to ensure that an overly enthusiastic new hire does not upload files or other documents onto the new employer’s computer system that were wrongly acquired from a prior employer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/fmla-leave"&gt;Commonly asked questions about FMLA leave&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of employment your staff will be faced with many issues that may result in them needing to take time away from work. While these breaks can be disruptive for a workplace and may result in loss of production many employers are required by federal law to provide leave for family and medical related issues. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FLMA) was designed to protect employees from termination for needing to care for themselves and their loved ones in times of need. The FMLA can be confusing for many employers to follow, so here are a few answers to the most common questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="one"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Am I required to give FMLA leave?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally employers with 50 or more employees must comply with the FMLA. All employees, whether part time or full time, and even temporary workers, are included in the count to reach 50. Also, employers must count all employees whose names appear are on the payroll (whether compensation is received or not) toward the 50 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the following employers must comply regardless of number of employees:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;any public agency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;public and private elementary and secondary schools,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the United States and its agencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;members of Congress (the Senate and House of Representatives)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the federal Executive Branch (including the Postal Service, Postal Rate Commission)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;state government, regardless of the number of employees in any agency or department&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;local government.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="one"&gt;​&lt;strong&gt;Who is eligible for medical leave?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all employees of a covered employer are eligible for FMLA leave.  An eligible employee is one who:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;has been employed for at least 12 months by the employer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has performed at least 1,250 hours of service during the previous 12 months&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is employed at a worksite where 50 or more employees are employed within 75 miles of the employee’s worksite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three requirements must be met for both private and public employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="one"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For what reasons can an employee take FMLA leave?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eligible employees are entitled to take 12 weeks of FMLA under the following circumstances:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;for the birth of a son or daughter (including the child of a domestic partner or a  same-sex domestic partner) and to care for the newborn child&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for the placement, with the employee, of a son or daughter for adoption or foster care&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to care for the employee’s spouse, son, daughter or parent who has a serious health condition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;because of a serious health condition which makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of his or her job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for qualifying exigency event(s) while a covered service member is on active duty or call to active duty status.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="one"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For what medical reasons can an employee take FMLA leave?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An eligible employee is entitled to take FMLA leave for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;his or her own serious health condition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the serious health condition of a spouse, son, daughter, or parent. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The employee’s serious health condition must render the employee unable to perform his or her position.  This requirement is met when the employee’s health care provider indicates that the employee is unable to work at all or is unable to perform any one of the essential functions of his or her position.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FMLA does not list conditions which satisfy the serious health condition definition.  Rather, the FMLA regulations broadly define “serious health condition” as an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition which involves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;inpatient care&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continuing treatment by a healthcare provider. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While not a full list of serious health conditions examples does not exist, some common examples include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;heart attack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stroke&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;epilepsy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cancer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;diabetes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;migraines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;head trauma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;flu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;arthritis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;depression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;substance abuse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anxiety&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concussion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;asthma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;injuries suffered on the job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;recovery from surgery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;multiple sclerosis.&lt;/li&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/whistleblower"&gt;Whistleblowing&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is whistleblowing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;While the definition of whistleblower varies depending on the statue being cited, the term generally describes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;an employee who reports &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;an employer for violations of laws or regulations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;To give a little more detail we can look at one commonly cited definition of whistleblower, found in the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act): &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“No person shall discharge or in any manner discriminate against any employee because such employee has filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to this Act or has testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding or because of the exercise of such employee on the behalf of himself, herself, or others of any right afforded under this Act.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What are the possible sources of whistleblower protection?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;There are various sources a whistleblowing employee may turn to in seeking protection against employer retaliation.  These sources include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;federal statutes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;state statutes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;retaliatory discharge claims based on state common law exceptions to the employment-at-will doctrine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;When it comes to federal and state statutory protection, whistleblower protection for employees may result from general whistleblower laws or topic-/industry-specific statutes that cover whistleblowing.  These topic- and industry-specific statutes may provide protection to certain employees who report employer actions that violate the particular statute.  However, not all state and federal statutes contain whistleblower provisions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What protections are there for whistleblowers under federal law?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;There are several federal protections for employees who decide to report their employers. Additionally, many states have their own laws to protect whistleblowers – employers should check with their Department of Labor for more information. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="p6"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Occupation Safety and Health Act (OSHA)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p6"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Section 11(c) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act protects employees from discrimination for filing an OSHA complaint.  Further testimony in an OSHA proceeding (including inspections) are protected, as are safety complaints to an employee’s employer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p6"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;An employee alleging a violation of Section 11(c) of OSHA may file a complaint with the Director of OSHA within 30 days of the alleged violation – unless there is a basis to equitably toll the 30-day requirement. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p6"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sarbanes-Oxley&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p6"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Employees of publicly traded companies are protected by whistleblowing provisions of Section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act from retaliation for:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li class="p6"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;providing information&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p6"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;testifying regarding employer conduct the employee reasonably believes violates:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p6"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;mail, bank, wire or securities laws&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li class="p6"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The False Claims Act protects employees reporting on their employers and/or others who are defrauding government programs.  Complaining parties are entitled under a &lt;i&gt;qui tam&lt;/i&gt; provision, which allows individuals to sue on the government’s behalf and be entitled to a percentage of any recovered damages.  Actions are brought in federal court.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How can employers avoid whistleblower claims?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p6"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Employees may find protection from employer retaliation from a variety of sources.  To prevent whistleblower claims, employers should familiarize themselves with the laws that apply to their particular operations, including state and federal statutes and any applicable anti-retaliation provisions.  Employers should also consider implementing procedures to address employee reports of co-worker or employer wrongdoing.  Examples of such procedures include established methods to govern investigations and/or how to implement corrective measures.  In addition, employers should remember the main purposes behind whistleblower laws are:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="p6"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;to protect employees who engage in good-faith reporting of employer wrongdoing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p7"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p6"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;to encourage employee reporting of employer wrongdoing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="p6"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;When dealing with whistleblowers, employers should remember the purpose of whistleblower laws and the protections they potentially afford to employees. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/nepotism"&gt;Nepotism: Favoring relatives and friends in the workplace&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not unusual for multiple members of a family to work for the same employer.  However, such situations can be troublesome if the family members are in a superior-subordinate relationship because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 0.5in;"&gt;the relationship may give rise to favoritism or to suspicions of it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-left: 0.5in;"&gt;the subordinate family member takes advantage of the situation by not working as hard or by not following the orders of the superior family member&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-left: 0.5in;"&gt;the superior family member cannot or will not control the activities of the subordinate (including administering discipline when needed or offering constructive criticism on performance evaluations). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sometimes happens that employees in a superior-subordinate relationship marry during the employment.  Employers generally allow both parties to remain with the company unless there is no open position to which one of the employees may be moved.  However, it is important to address such situations on a case-by-case basis to avoid gender discrimination claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;In hiring&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recruitment of current employees’ relatives tends to perpetuate the racial, religious and ethnic characteristics of the existing workforce.  Therefore, nepotistic recruiting may be discriminatory where the current workforce is predominantly or exclusively of one race, religion or ethnic group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Policies against nepotism&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-nepotism policies prevent related individuals from working in the same company or department.  Employers choosing to adopt such a policy should state that cases concerning the employment of relatives will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis to ensure maximum flexibility in handling such situations.  Also, the policy should contain an explanation of why the employer discourages the employment of relatives and should describe the circumstances and types of relationships covered by the policy.  The employer might also include a list of circumstances and relationships that would be permitted by the policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of sound reasons for anti-nepotism rules and “no fraternization” policies including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 0.5in;"&gt;avoiding involvement in emotional problems at the home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-left: 0.5in;"&gt;avoiding supervisory conflicts between spouses and relatives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-left: 0.5in;"&gt;avoiding hiring decisions based on favoritism or the appearance of favoritism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-left: 0.5in;"&gt;avoiding vacation and day off scheduling problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-left: 0.5in;"&gt;avoiding family influence regarding grievances and work conflicts. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Title VII does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of marital status.  However, many state laws prohibit employers from discriminating based on marital status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A thoughtful “anti-nepotism” policy should allow the employment of family members while avoiding the common operational issues associated with such situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-left:12.0pt;"&gt;
&lt;h2 class="sample-title"&gt;Sample anti-nepotism policy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC Company welcomes the opportunity to hire and retain qualified employees who are related to one another by blood or marriage.  However, since such relationships sometimes can create problems in the workplace, including suspicions of favoritism if the related employees are in a supervisor-subordinate relationship, it is the policy of ABC that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any employee of ABC who has or acquires a familial relationship (as defined below) with another employee shall not have any direct or indirect administrative or operational authority over the other person.  This prohibition means not only that a person cannot supervise a family member but also that the family member cannot be in that person's chain of command; for example, a family member cannot work in a department in which a family member is the Vice President.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An employee of ABC cannot use his/her authority or position with ABC to benefit or to disadvantage another employee in a familial relationship.  Although all such potential misuses of authority cannot be listed here, examples include an employee signing an evaluation for a family member or signing/approving a check payable to a family member.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employees are required to notify the company’s Human Resources Department of (a) any existing familial relationships; (b) any familial relationships that are created among employees (for example, by the marriage of two employees); and (c) the potential employment by ABC of a family member.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ABC will refuse to hire a job applicant who is in a familial relationship with a current employee if the applicant would be in a supervisory or subordinate position to the existing employee.  ABC employees who marry one another during their employment will be allowed to remain with the company unless they are in a superior-subordinate relationship and there is no open position to which one of them may be moved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Familial relationship” within the meaning of this policy means two employees (or an employee and a job applicant) in the relationship of husband, wife, father, mother, brother, sister, son, daughter, uncle, aunt, nephew, niece, grandfather, grandmother, grandson or granddaughter, or any of those relationships arising as a result of marriage (for example, brother-in-law).   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/hagood-tighe"&gt;Interview with attorney J. Hagood Tighe&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Tell us about Fisher &amp; Phillips:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fisher &amp; Phillips is a national labor and employment law firm representing management side only.  We have over 30 offices across the country.  We pride ourselves on providing proactive and practical advice (as demonstrated by the Reference Guide), but we also handle employment litigation when it arises.  Additionally, our firm has a significant traditional labor practice, representing companies in union avoidance campaigns, collective bargaining, and contact administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Who works on the South Carolina Employment Law Reference Guide?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is really a team effort coordinated by my assistant, Suzanne King.  She has it down to a science.  We have a team of lawyers each year who review and update a group of chapters in their areas of practice.  This year, the attorneys involved included Cheryl Behymer, Michael Carrouth, Matt Korn, Reyburn Lominack, Karen Luchka Wingo, Fred Manning, Steve Mitchell, Jon Pearson, Edward Rawl, George Reeves, Bill Wright, and myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. How do you think the South Carolina Employment Law Reference Guide benefits readers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great resource that helps managers and HR professional be sure they are spotting the issues.  Every year, the law changes, develops, expands, etc.  This allows employers keep on top of the latest developments to be sure they are doing all that is required of them.  And, most importantly, it helps them be good employers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. What do you think is the biggest issue employers face currently in employment law?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a tough question.  There are so many issues.  But, I would say one of the biggest issues is the EEOC’s focus on systemic discrimination.  I say this because this is discrimination that is NOT intentional.  Instead, it results from a facially neutral policy or practice, usually implemented with good intentions, but that has the unintended result of affecting one or more protected classes.  This is hard for employers because it is not easy to spot and correct, even for the most sophisticated HR professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Finally, to get to know you better, we want to know: What do you like on your pizza?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not on my pizza – with my pizza.  A nice glass of red wine please.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/vacation-policy"&gt;Vacation policies and time off&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana; color: rgb(35, 35, 35);"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px"&gt;Not all employers provide employees with vacation time, but for those who do it is wise to have a clear, well-enforced policy in place to prevent confusion and help employees understand what steps need to be followed in order to use their time off. If employers decide to to provide time off they need to make sure to do so in a uniform manner and apply the same regulations to each employee. Written vacation policies are the easiest way to communicate the requirements for taking time away from the office and to express in no uncertain terms what the employees responsibilities are for their time spent away, i.e., if they need to find a replacement for their duties or schedule their time in a certain manner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana; color: rgb(35, 35, 35); min-height: 17px;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana; color: rgb(35, 35, 35);"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eligibility for vacation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana; color: rgb(35, 35, 35);"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px"&gt;Employers are not required to offer vacation time. However, for those that do, a good start to any vacation policy is to define which employees are eligible for vacation. For example: do full-time and part-time employees receive vacation days? Do employees need to be employed for a certain amount of months before they receive days?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana; color: rgb(35, 35, 35);"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana; color: rgb(35, 35, 35);"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Accrual of vacation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 21.3px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana; color: rgb(35, 35, 35);"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px"&gt;After defining who is eligible for vacation time, the next step is to outline how a vacation is earned. A policy could provide that vacation accrues on the anniversary date of the employee’s hire or that three vacation hours accrue per pay period. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 21.3px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana; color: rgb(35, 35, 35);"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px"&gt;If accrual varies for different types of employees, the policy should clearly explain the different rates. For example, full-time employees might receive three vacation hours per pay period, whereas part-time employees might receive only two vacation hours per pay period.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana; color: rgb(35, 35, 35);"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px"&gt;When writing a policy, the employer should keep in mind that accruing vacation days is not the same as earning vacation pay.  For instance, a particular policy might allow for accrual of 40 hours of vacation pay, but also provide that unused vacation hours will not be paid upon termination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana; color: rgb(35, 35, 35); min-height: 17px;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana; color: rgb(35, 35, 35);"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Taking vacation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 21.3px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana; color: rgb(35, 35, 35);"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px"&gt;After the “who” and the “how” of earning vacations has been explained, a policy should cover by what method vacation time is to be cashed in. A vacation policy may place limitations on when employees can take vacation and may require advance notice and employer approval.  For instance, a vacation policy might require employees to take vacation during the annual plant shutdown or only with four weeks’ advance notice. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 21.3px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana; color: rgb(35, 35, 35);"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sample policies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 21.3px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana; color: rgb(35, 35, 35);"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px"&gt;The first policy below is a general use policy that can be easily adapted to address most offices. Also included is a policy based on a maximum accrual, and a policy based on annual accrual. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="forms-heading" style="margin: 0px 0px 6px 12px; text-align: center; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px"&gt;SAMPLE POLICY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 12px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px"&gt;It is the policy of ABC Company to provide each full-time employee with vacation time on a periodic basis.  The amount of vacation to which an employee becomes entitled is determined by the employee’s length of service as of his or her employment anniversary date.  For full-time employees, vacation accrues as follows:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 12px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana; min-height: 17px;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 48px; text-indent: -36px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana; min-height: 17px;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 48px; text-indent: -36px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana; min-height: 17px;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 48px; text-indent: -36px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px"&gt;    3.    Five years or more but less than 10 years of service, three weeks, or 120 hours, of vacation per year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 48px; text-indent: -36px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana; min-height: 17px;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 48px; text-indent: -36px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px"&gt;    4.    Ten years or more of service, four weeks, or 160 hours, of vacation per year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 48px; text-indent: -36px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana; min-height: 17px;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 12px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px"&gt;Regular part-time employees earn vacation on their employment anniversary date in the proportion that their normally scheduled number of hours bears to 40 per week.  For example, a regular, part-time employee who usually works 20 hours per week would earn 20 hours of vacation upon completing his or her first year of service.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 12px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana; min-height: 17px;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 12px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px"&gt;Vacation does not accrue between employment anniversary dates and may not be taken until it is earned.  Vacation time must be used in the anniversary year after which it is earned and may not be carried over past the employee’s next anniversary date.  For example, an employee with two weeks’ vacation as of his or her third anniversary date must use the two weeks prior to his or her fourth anniversary date.  If an employee fails to take his or her earned vacation time before the employee’s anniversary date in violation of this policy, the employee will not earn any further vacation until that unused vacation has been taken.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 12px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana; min-height: 17px;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 12px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px"&gt;Earned vacation must be taken.  Employees are not entitled to pay in lieu of taking time off for vacation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 6px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana; min-height: 17px;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px"&gt;Our “vacation year” is based upon [anniversary/calendar] year.  This means that your vacation year begins on [the date you started work with our Company and runs until the day before that date in the next calendar year[ OR [January 1 and ends on December 31 of each year].  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana; min-height: 17px;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px"&gt;Full-time employees accrue vacation at the rate set forth in the following schedule:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/back-to-school"&gt;Back to school time is here! &lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div class="p1" id="product-page-description" p=""&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Every August millions of students return to school from summer vacation. While it may not seem that relevant to the 9 to 5 workforce, the school year can impact employers in several ways, from internships to continuing education benefits Here are a few things to look out for as school gets back in session.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;h2 class="one"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Ending internships&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The internship should be for a set amount of time, established prior to the start of the internship.  Further, unpaid internships should not be used by the employer as a trial period for individuals seeking employment at the conclusion of the internship.  If an intern is placed with the employer for a trial period with the expectation that he or she will then be hired on a permanent basis, the court will consider that individual to be an employee under the FLSA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="one"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Student learners&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Individuals who qualify as student learners are not prohibited from working in certain occupations which are otherwise restricted to them by virtue of their age. To qualify, the individual must meet the following criteria:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;16 to 18 years of age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;enrolled in a youth vocation training program under a recognized state or local educational authority&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;employed under a written agreement which contains the name of the student learner, and is signed by the employer, school coordinator, principal and parent or legal guardian. The agreement must provide that: &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;the work in the occupation declared particularly hazardous will be incidental to the training&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;the work will be intermittent and for short periods of time and under the direct and close supervision of a qualified and experienced person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;that safety instruction will be given by the school and correlated by the employer with on-the-job training&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;a schedule of organized and progressive work processes to be performed on the job will be prepared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;	&lt;span class="s1"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Only certain occupations, otherwise prohibited for individuals under age 18, are permitted under this exception for student learners.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="one"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Continuing education benefits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Some employers provide educational assistance to employees for certain education expenses incurred by its employees on a tax-advantaged basis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Qualifying expenses include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;tuition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;fees&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;supplies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;books&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;equipment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Qualifying expenses generally do not include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;education related to hobbies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;games&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;sports. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Undergraduate and graduate degree courses may qualify.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Employers are not obligated to reimburse employees for continuing education programs.  Many employers choose to do so, however, because they believe such programs benefit the company by encouraging employees to become better educated in their respective fields of specialization and thereby improving company productivity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;If an employer elects to have a tuition reimbursement program, its terms should be in writing and contain the requirements for receiving reimbursement.  To provide the employee funds for educational purposes in advance, the employer may wish to utilize a loan document and wage assignment to authorize payroll deduction in the event the employee terminates employment prior to completing the course or otherwise fails to complete or pass the course.  It also should be noted that employees generally must be compensated for time spent attending mandatory on‑the‑job training programs or seminars.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-left:12.0pt;"&gt;
&lt;h2 class="sample-title"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;SAMPLE POLICY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;As a full‑time employee of ABC Company, you may qualify for tuition reimbursement.  The Company will reimburse you fully for tuition, fees, and books for courses taken that are directly related to improvement of relevant job skills with the Company.  This policy also covers all courses taken to fulfill the requirements of a degree program approved by your manager.  All reimbursements are subject to the approval of your supervisor or manager and the Human Resources Manager.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;All tuition reimbursements must be requested in writing and approved prior to beginning the course.  Reimbursement may be subject to taxes.  To qualify for reimbursement, you must receive a passing grade and you must be an employee in good standing at the time of reimbursement.  Courses must be taken at times other than during scheduled working hours.  Proof of passing grade or certificate of satisfactory course completion and receipts for tuition, fees, and books must be turned in to the Human Resources Department in order to receive your reimbursement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="one"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Parental leave&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;During the last decade, there has been an increased interest in promoting flexibility for employees with caregiver responsibilities, including parents of school-aged children.  Federal lawmakers have proposed amending the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) to allow employees to take unpaid leave to participate in their children's school-related and educational activities.  These activities might include parent-teacher conferences, class parties, volunteer activities, assemblies, sporting events, and other extracurricular activities.  Currently, there is no obligation under either federal law to offer employees parental leave. If the employer elects to offer paid or unpaid parental leave, a policy should be spelled out in clear and detailed terms so that employees understand the nature and limitations of the benefit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Some employers choose not to offer parental leave because it is a benefit that is not available to all employees and because parental leave can be difficult to define and limit.  Alternatively, if an employer does not want to offer separate parental leave, the employer’s policies concerning personal days or paid time off (PTO) (discussed above) could provide that such leave can be used at the employee’s discretion for activities such as parent-teacher conferences or other school events.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-left:12.0pt;"&gt;
&lt;h2 class="sample-title"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;SAMPLE POLICY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;ABC Company recognizes that many of its employees must balance work requirements with parental responsibilities.  For this reason, the Company provides unpaid parental leave to full‑time employees who are the parent, guardian, or foster parent of a child (or children) who is attending school or licensed daycare and is under age 18.  Parental leave may be used only for the employee’s attendance of conferences or classroom activities that cannot be scheduled during the employee’s non-work hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Eligible employees may take up to 10 hours of unpaid parental leave per child during any calendar year.  An employee may substitute accrued paid vacation leave or other appropriate paid leave for unpaid parental leave.  Parental leave must be requested at least one week in advance and approved by Human Resources and the employee’s supervisor.  Employees using unpaid parental leave may be required to provide written documentation of their attendance of a conference or classroom activity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/favorite-sites"&gt;Favorite HR sites&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to employment law, staying up to date with the latest law updates and best practices can seem like a full-time job, and a boring one at that! We like to keep current with the latest HR happenings by routinely checking a few blogs and websites. Each website offers a different perspective or delivery on HR that keeps us entertained AND informed, a task that can be a tall order when it comes to the sometimes dry world of employment law. Check out a few of our favorite resources here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tlnt.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLNT.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Buzzfeed's list format is your jam, this is the HR site for you. With a variety of best practice articles, webinars, and some fun graphics, TLNT keeps learning about employment law fun and fresh. Plus it's updated often and the articles are a quick read, perfect for when you need a five minute break from that stack of I-9 forms.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://Fistfuloftalent.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Fistfuloftalent.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A snarky, biting round up of articles from industry pros on management and recruiting, Fistful of Talent ain't your mamas HR site. With loads of videos, podcasts, and even Wu-Tang themed articles, this site is definitely the sexier approach to employment law. We like to read it to remind ourselves that HR can be fun and modern, and that it's not just FMLA leave and worker's compensation claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://payscale.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;payscale.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though it's not all about the Benjamins on this pay-focused site, the main focus is certainly on a salary database that offers averages of pay for roles with the ability to adjust based on experience and location. Additonally the site hosts some great original articles with a uniquely casual point of view, as they are usually not written by lawyers. A great resource to reference during pay negotions or the job description writing phase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wage-hour.net" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wage-hour.net&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are way into the whole "Law &amp; Order" thing this wage-focused blog from our buds at Fisher Phillips is for you. The blog takes a more case-by-case approach (see what we did there?) to employment law, examining the latest court findings and reflecting on their importance in the larger HR landscape. The experts at Fisher &amp; Phillips do an excellent job of explaining the legal background of each case and what you need to know going forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://socialmediaemploymentlawblog.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;socialmediaemploymentlawblog.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is one thing we love reading about on the Internet, it's the Internet! This social media focused blog from the labor law gurus at Cozen O'Connor tracks the overlap of social media and employment law – an area that seems to be shifting day by day. For those Cliffs Notes fans out there "the employer take away" is pure gold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyday People: &lt;a href="http://sbrownehr.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;sbrownehr.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting the HUMAN back in Human Resources. Written by Steve Browne, and HR vet and all-around optimist. His long essays on the soul of employment will leave you feeling a renewed energy for connecting with staff on a person-to-person basis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Tell us about Shawe Rosenthal:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shawe Rosenthal LLP specializes in representing and advising management in employment and labor issues.  We represent employers throughout the United States in federal and state courts, before the EEOC, NLRB, DOL, and other administrative agencies, as well as in arbitrations and mediations.  Our clients range from Fortune 100 companies to smaller businesses and non-profits in a wide range of industries.  Our practice includes both litigation and preventive measures.  We place great emphasis on providing effective and efficient advocacy, responsive client service, and sound practical advice.  Our firm and attorneys have been recognized as leaders in this field by such organizations as the College of Labor and Employment Fellows, Chambers USA, Best Lawyers, and Super Lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Who works on the Maryland Human Resources Manual and the Model Policies and Forms for Maryland Employers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, a number of our attorneys have contributed significantly to these publications, including Mark J. Swerdlin, who served as the Editor for many years.  This year, it was my pleasure to take over for Mark, and I was responsible for this year’s revisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. How do you think the Maryland Human Resources Manual and the Model Policies and Forms for Maryland Employers benefits readers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These publications provide Maryland employers with a comprehensive and practical overview of applicable federal and state laws.  The Manual serves as a guide to the panoply of HR compliance issues and concerns facing employers in this state.  The Model Policies and Forms are a useful and thoughtful resource for employers seeking to implement a wide range of policies and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. What do you think is the biggest issue employers face currently in employment law?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a multi-pronged effort at all levels of government – federal, state and local – to change the legal environment with regard to traditional labor and employment law, without real consideration of the practical effects on businesses. We are seeing states and cities pursuing minimum wage increases and ban the box legislation, as well as new forms of paid leave.  Under President Obama’s administration, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has issued new and aggressive guidance documents that expand the parameters of settled law on pregnancy discrimination and criminal background checks, the Department of Labor has been directed to issue new regulations intended to increase the number of workers entitled to overtime pay, and the National Labor Relations Board is challenging standard and long-standing employer practices and policies as violations of the National Labor Relations Act.  I think that staying on top of all the changes to the laws and regulations, and dealing with the (unintended) consequences of these changes, is the biggest issue that employers are facing at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Finally, to get to know you better, we want to know: What do you like on your pizza?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/wearable-tech"&gt;Wearable Technology&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description" p=""&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last year, we have seen a rise in wearable technology.  From the newly released Apple Watch to the spread of Bluetooth devices, it seems that technology is becoming more integrated into our daily lives than ever.  These new advancements are causing people are to view their technology as a permanent accessory and not just a device that is used periodically throughout the day.  Many carry their cellphones constantly in their hands, feeling the need to have them easily accessible at moments notice.  While this shift towards constant technology use can result in higher productivity and better communication, it can also cause a whole mess of problems for employers.  Below are a few issues that can arise out of what experts are calling "wearable technology."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protecting company information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="one"&gt;While convenient and popular with employees, the common practice of allowing employees to use electronic devices throughout the day poses significant risks that require careful management.  The practice results in company information residing on devices/networks that the company does not own or control.  When the security and protection of the company information is left up the discretion of the employee, information may not be as secure as an employer would like it to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="one"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Texting during work hours &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="one"&gt;There are positives aspects to text messaging that can be applied to the workplace.  For instance, employees could be in an environment where they cannot make a phone call or send an email.  Such an instance may arise in a sales pitch.  Sales personnel might need to send a quick message to someone at the home office to verify a calculation.  Unfortunately, using a telephone to call or a computer to send an email to someone at the home office would likely not be an option during a sales pitch.  Despite the positive aspects of text messages and the sometimes unavoidable reality of text messages, many issues arise as a result of texting in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="two"&gt;Non working hours&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="two"&gt;Some supervisors may text their subordinates with a question or assignment after the subordinate has gone home.  Requiring nonexempt employees to handle work-related texts without recording their hours worked could result in litigation under the FLSA involving lost wages, liquidated damages and attorneys’ fees.  If supervisors frequently text nonexempt employees with work questions or assignments when they are no longer working, the employer could be subject to a FLSA class action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="two"&gt;Safety&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="two"&gt;Cellphone use is frequently a distraction.  In an environment with dangerous equipment, employees could injure themselves if they are distracted by their electronic device and thus open the employer up to workers’ compensation claims and liability under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Act.  Further, employees who drive while texting could cause an accident, again opening the employer up to workers’ compensation claims or tort liability for third parties injured in the accident.  Finally, certain states, such as California, prohibit texting when driving altogether.  In those states, if employees text while driving, they are not legally compliant.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="two"&gt;Document retention&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="two"&gt;Text message, brief phone calls, and social media use are generally not routed through an employer’s network meaning that unlike email exchanges, employers often have a difficult time tracking and recording for future reference.  What is said via these outlets may have important business significance and it is up to the employer to instill policies which prompt employees to make records of such information exchanges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="two"&gt;Alternatively, such exchanges between employees are not documented and if anything illegal or improper transpires employers will have a difficult time getting to the bottom of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;p class="one"&gt;When you think about workplace safety, you probably picture injuries and accidents, but in reality, safety means much more than that.  The hardest aspect of having a safe workplace is thinking about the unexpected threats, the freak incidents as well as the hidden everyday dangers.  Employers can be intimidated by the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act) because a majority of it applies to very specific industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="one"&gt;This list is meant to help the everyday office become a little bit safer.  Take a minute to make sure you are doing all you can to keep your staff safe!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is the required OSHA “Job Safety and Health Protection” poster displayed in a prominent location where all employees are likely to see it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have arrangements been made to retain records for the time period required for each specific type of record? (Some records must be maintained for at least 40 years.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are operating permits and records up-to-date for items such as elevators, air pressure tanks, liquefied petroleum gas tanks, etc.?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have an active safety and health program in operation that includes general safety and health program elements as well as the management of hazards specific to your work-site?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is one person clearly responsible for the safety and health program?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have a safety committee or group made up of management and labor representatives that meets regularly and reports in writing on its activities?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have a working procedure to handle in-house employee complaints regarding safety and health?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you considered incentives for employees or workgroups who excel in reducing workplace injury/illnesses?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a hospital, clinic or infirmary for medical care near your workplace or is at least one employee on each shift currently qualified to render first aid?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have all employees who are expected to respond to medical emergencies as part of their job responsibilities:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;received first aid training?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;had the hepatitis B vaccination made available to them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;had appropriate training on procedures to protect them from bloodborne pathogens, including universal precautions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;been trained how to use and have available appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect against exposure to bloodborne diseases?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are emergency phone numbers posted?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are fully-supplied first aid kits easily accessible to each work area, periodically inspected and replenished as needed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is your local fire department familiar with your facility, its location, and specific hazards?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are all fire doors and shutters in good operating condition?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are all worksites clean, sanitary and orderly?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are all work surfaces kept dry and appropriate means taken to assure the surfaces are slip-resistant?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are all aisles and passageways kept clear and marked as appropriate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are all exits marked with an exit sign and illuminated by a reliable light source?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are all the directions to exits, when not immediately apparent, marked with visible signs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are all exits kept free of obstructions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there sufficient exits to permit prompt escape in case of emergency?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are all ladders maintained in good condition, joints between steps and side rails tight, all hardware and fittings securely attached, and moveable parts operating freely without binding or undue play?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are all tools and equipment (both company and employee-owned) used at the workplace in good condition?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a training program to instruct employees on safe methods of machine operation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there adequate supervision to ensure that employees are following safe machine operating procedures?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a regular program of safety inspection of machinery and equipment?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are all machinery and equipment kept clean and properly maintained?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is sufficient clearance provided around and between machines to allow for safe operations, set up and servicing, material handling and waste removal?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are “NO SMOKING” signs posted on liquefied petroleum gas tanks and in areas where flammable or combustible materials are used or stored?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a current written exposure control plan for occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens and other potentially infectious materials, where applicable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there areas in the workplace where continuous noise levels exceed 85 decibels?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do employees who operate vehicles on public thoroughfares have valid operator’s licenses?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more on safety and required postings, be sure to check out our &lt;a href="https://hrsimple.com/product/workplace-safety-and-health-compliance-manual"&gt;Workplace Safety and Health Compliance Manual&lt;/a&gt; written by Ed Foulke, Jr., a partner with Fisher &amp; Phillips LLP and former head of OSHA, as well as our &lt;a href="https://hrsimple.com/federal-poster"&gt;Federal Compliance Poster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/immigration-update"&gt;Immigration: new authorization to work &lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;div class="layoutArea"&gt;
&lt;div class="column"&gt;
&lt;h2 class="one"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16.000000pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman,Bold'"&gt;Five Million Undocumented Workers May Be Eligible for Work Authorization in May 2015 Based on New Executive Order &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="one"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16.000000pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman,Bold'"&gt;By: &lt;a href="https://hrsimple.com/partners/authors/julie-pace"&gt;Julie Pace&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href="http://hrsimple.com/partners/firms/cavanagh-law-firm-pa-%E2%80%93-arizona"&gt;The Cavanagh Law Firm, PA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="one"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="one"&gt;On Thursday, November 20, 2014, President Obama issued an Executive Order that will create the opportunity for an estimated 5 million undocumented individuals to obtain work authorization and temporarily stay in the U.S. without fear of deportation for three years, which can be renewed for additional three year periods. Similar to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, individuals under the new Executive Order will not obtain citizenship or legal permanent resident status, but if they meet the program’s requirement they can obtain temporary employment authorization and be safe from deportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="one"&gt;The Executive Order has a three prong approach consisting of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li class="one"&gt;a crackdown on border security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="one"&gt;a focus on deporting felons and not families&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="no-bullet" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ol start="3"&gt;&lt;li class="one"&gt;accountability of immigrants already unlawfully present in the U.S.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p class="one"&gt;The first prong of the Executive Order calls for an increase in border security to prevent individuals from entering the U.S. through improper channels and to decrease the flow of undocumented immigrants across the borders. The President’s actions will also centralize border security command-and-control to help effectuate the increased border enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="one"&gt;The second prong of the Executive Order sets a focus on deporting “felons, not families,” as the President stated in his speech. This builds on the 2012 directive from former Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents focus resources on detaining and deporting only those individuals who presented a danger or threat to national security or public safety. The President has ordered ICE to place those suspected of terrorism, violent criminals, gang members, and individuals who have recently and unlawfully crossed the border into the U.S. at the top of the deportation priority list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="one"&gt;The third prong of the Executive Order creates the Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA) program, which allows certain individuals who do not possess legal status to obtain work authorization and protection from deportation, similar to DACA. This opportunity is available to immigrants who meet the following requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;must have lived continuously in the U.S. since January 1, 2010&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;must be the parent of a U.S. citizen or Lawful Permanent Resident (does not cover parents of DACA recipients) as of November 20, 2014&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;must register and pass a criminal and national security background check&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="no-bullet" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;must begin paying taxes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program is expected to be available beginning approximately May 20, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The President also announced that the DACA program will be expanded. The original program was limited to individuals under the age of 31 who had arrived in the U.S. prior to June 15, 2007. The expanded program will cover individuals who arrived in the U.S. before January 1, 2010, and removes the cap on maximum age. The remaining requirements, such as arriving in the U.S. before the age of 16 and attending or having attended a U.S. school remain. These changes make an estimated 270,000 more people eligible for DACA. President Obama also announced that DACA relief will be granted for three years (renewable), rather than the two years granted in the original program. These changes will be made by approximately the end of February 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the three main components of the President’s Executive Order, the President announced changes to visa programs that provide work authorization for high-skilled workers awaiting Lawful Permanent Resident status and their spouses. Under the current scheme, employees with approved Lawful Permanent Resident applications may wait many years for their visa to become available. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plans to make regulatory changes to allow these workers to move or change jobs more easily. DHS is also finalizing new rules to give certain H-1B spouses employment authorization as long as the H-1B spouse has an approved Lawful Permanent Resident application. DHS also plans to provide additional immigration options for foreign entrepreneurs who meet certain criteria for creating jobs, attracting investment, and generating revenue in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many companies may see a dramatic increase in the amount of labor force ready, available, and eager to work. Additionally, employers may be approached by current employees who had obtained work initially with falsified documents seeking to update their identification and work authorization information because they have received lawful work authorization. The information provided to complete the new I-9 and go through E-Verify may be significantly different than what the employee had presented to the employer at the initial time of hire. If a current employee seeks to update his or her identification or work authorization information based on a recent acquisition of legal status, employers should contact legal counsel regarding the steps to take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, employers may experience a high return of former employees presenting new identification or work authorization information based on obtaining legal status. Whether or not employers decide to rehire these individuals or to continue to employ current employees who present new information is a business decision and the prudent employer should consult legal counsel about the actions to take when rehiring former employees who now present new or different documents to complete the I-9 and E-Verify process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies should be completing internal I-9 and E-Verify training regularly, conducting internal audits and ensuring immigration compliance is occurring at theircompanies. The Cavanagh Law Firm offers a wide array of legal services involving the Form I-9, E-Verify, immigration compliance, audits, and employment law issues including training employers to understand their immigration compliance obligation, while avoiding harassment, discrimination, and retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Julie Pace’s practice handles employment law, handbooks, drug and alcohol policies, I-9 and E-Verify compliance, OSHA, independent contractor and alleged misclassification issues with DES and other government agencies, and defends claims of sexual harassment, employment discrimination, retaliation, whistleblower, and wrongful discharge, and against charges by the EEOC or ACRD. She handles matters involving OSHA, ICE, OFCCP, DOL, NLRB, ADA, FMLA, and wage and hour laws. She regularly provides training to companies and assists with investigations.

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/interview-attorneys-kastner-westman-wilkins"&gt;Interview with attorneys at Kastner Westman &amp; Wilkins&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hrsimple.com/partners/firms/kastner-westman-wilkins"&gt;Kastner Westman &amp; Wilkins&lt;/a&gt; recently took over our &lt;a href="https://hrsimple.com/resources/ohio-hr-library"&gt;Ohio Human Resources Library&lt;/a&gt;. We’re excited to be working with them, and we think you should be too! Keep reading to learn a little more about this amazing Akron-based firm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Tell us about Kastner Westman &amp; Wilkins, LLC:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kastner Westman &amp; Wilkins is an Akron, Ohio-based boutique labor and employment law firm of 12 attorneys, representing management exclusively. It was formed in 2000. KWW attorneys provide comprehensive counsel on labor and employment law issues, including benefits, workers’ compensation and HR management for their clients, which include public, private, and non-profit entities of all types and sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Who works on the Ohio Human Resources Library?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hrsimple.com/partners/authors/thomas-evan-green"&gt;Thomas Evan Green&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://hrsimple.com/partners/authors/amanda-s-smith"&gt;Amanda Smith&lt;/a&gt; served as the primary authors, with Kenneth Haneline and Mark Snyder providing additional support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. How do you think the Ohio Human Resources Library benefits readers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohio law, as it pertains to managing employees, is constantly changing, and with that we view the Ohio Human Resources Manual as a timely, effective reference guide for situations that arise in the workplace. It’s appropriate for small business owners and human resources professionals alike, regardless of their experience, and covers dozens of topics in great detail – yet it’s written in a manner that’s easy to understand and act upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. What do you think is the biggest issue employers face currently in employment law?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest employment law-related issue facing employers is keeping up with change. Whether it’s following and complying with changing federal, state and local laws; understanding how the proliferation of electronic devices and social media platforms impacts the workplace; or managing provisions within the Affordable Care Act that apply to their businesses, staying current on employment law issues and knowing when to seek outside counsel are among the most critical issues employers face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Finally, to get to know you better, we want to know: What do you like on your pizza?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we share many common professional interests in the vein of labor and employment law, our taste in pizza toppings is all over the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Evan Green: “When my wife is out of town, onions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda Smith: “Onions, mushrooms, banana peppers, and garlic sauce.  It also keeps vampires away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Haneline: “Sausage, pepperoni, peppers, onions, and diced baked potato (good for any Irish folks!)”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Snyder: “Buffalo style chicken and blue cheese.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/valentines"&gt;Valentine&#039;s Day heartaches around the office&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;div id="product-page-description"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;February 14th is quickly approaching and it brings with it a whole slew of troubles for employers. Aside from the usual romance in the workplace issues, employee attendance, harassment, and office parties can all cause an employer a good amount of trouble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interoffice romance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent CareerBuilder survey found that more than 37% of people have dated someone they work with over the course of their career. That’s more than a third of the workforce! While it’s great that your employees are finding happiness, there are a lot of issues that come along with office romances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="one"&gt;&lt;li class="bold noafter" style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-fraternization policies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="no-bullet" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;One option for employers is to completely prohibit relationships at work in order to reduce the risk of sexual harassment and related claims by instituting a “non-fraternization” policy. However, these policies can have negative effects as well. Most likely employees will continue to have relationships and employers won’t have the opportunity to lessen the possible negative results. Additionally, such a strict policy is bad for employee morale as it makes the employer appear overbearing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="bold noafter" style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Subordinates and managers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="no-bullet" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Office romances are also problematic when an employee in a position of power dates a subordinate. If the relationship sours, allegations of retaliation or harassment could be made. Even if the relationship goes well, other employees may say the supervisor is showing favoritism. Employers should consider a policy against such relationships, or one that requires employees to disclose these relationships and sign agreements that outline solutions if the relationship becomes problematic (i.e. one employee would be transferred).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="bold noafter" style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Love contracts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="no-bullet" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;A consensual relationship agreement, sometimes called a love contract, is a written document signed by two employees in a consensual relationship acknowledging the relationship is voluntary.  These disclosures usually contain a reminder of the company’s harassment, discrimination, and retaliation policies, as well as a clear acknowledgment that the relationship is consensual. These forms are a good way for employers to remind employees of their policies and protect themselves from future lawsuits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Harassment &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p4"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;One of the biggest concerns with Valentine’s Day is harassment. Employers should have a clear anti-harassment policy in place that outlines what behavior is acceptable and unacceptable. Such policies should clearly state that employees are safe from retaliation if they come forth with any harassment claims. Harassment can mean so much more than inappropriate advances or attention. Employers should be mindful that Valentine’s Day may bring up more suggestive conversation and unwanted attention. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p5"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Workplace conduct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p5"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Employers should have policies in place outlawing certain behaviors that can make other employees uncomfortable and lead to harassment charges. Employers should have policies that clearly state:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="p5"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;no overt displays of affection at work, including kissing or hand-holding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p5"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;work communications systems are to be used for work only – no personal email or voicemail using working time or company equipment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p5"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;employees must behave professionally and in a business-like manner while at work or all company functions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="p5"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;romantic squabbles should be left outside of the workplace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="p5"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guests and presents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p5"&gt;No boss wants to tell their employees they can’t have guests or receive gifts at work, but this can sometimes lead to loss of production and possible hostilities. While a policy banning these romantic gestures may cause ill will, managers should be mindful of employees productivity and should try to prevent any sort of hard feelings that come along when one employee receives gifts and others do not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p5"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Office parties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p5"&gt;While office parties always pose a fair amount of troubles, these hazards are worsened when romance is in the air. Many employers wish to celebrate the holiday as an office, and should consider doing so with a lunchtime treat or daytime party. If an employer wishes to have an after-hours party, they should be mindful of alcohol and the liabilities that come a long with it. Be aware that harassment claims rise when alcohol is involved and make sure that all employees are behaving responsibly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/overtime"&gt;It’s only a matter of overtime&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;p&gt;Have your employees been going the extra mile lately? What if they’re clocking in the equivalent of a marathon in hours? If you’re looking over your timesheets and notice that your star employee racked up a whopping 55 hours last week, it’s time to get familiar with the legal requirements of overtime pay. You’re going to need to calculate overtime whether or not the hours your employee worked were authorized by management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note: information in this article is applicable to hourly, non-exempt employees. For a more in-depth analysis of overtime pay, including regular rate of pay and exempt employees, check out the &lt;strong&gt;newly updated&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://hrsimple.com/product/wages-and-hours"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wages and Hours – An Employer’s Guide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="two"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the federal requirements for overtime pay?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requires that covered employers pay non-exempt employees for overtime at a rate of at least one and one-half times the employee’s regular wage rate for hours worked in excess of 40 hours in one workweek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overtime must be computed for each workweek – i.e., if an employee works 30 hours one week and 50 the next, the employer must pay the employee overtime compensation for 10 hours for the second week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="two"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I need to pay overtime for hours not worked?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hours that are paid but not worked do not have to be counted as hours worked under the FLSA, but you are free to treat them as hours worked either by agreement or as a matter of practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;holidays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vacations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sick days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;absences due to:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;voting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jury service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reporting to a draft board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;attending a family member’s funeral&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inability to reach work due to inclement weather.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="two"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should I include when calculating the regular rate of pay for my employees?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overtime pay rate is one and one-half times the employee’s regular rate. All compensation must be included in computing an employee’s regular rate unless specifically excluded by the FLSA. The FLSA excludes the following payments from the regular rate computation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;discretionary bonuses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prizes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gifts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expense reimbursements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;benefit plan contributions (generally do not include cafeteria plans that include a cash option)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;radio and television talent fees which satisfy government regulations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some stock options, including those exercised by non-exempt employees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;premium payments for overtime work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An employee’s regular rate is calculated by dividing the employee’s total weekly compensation by the total hours worked during the workweek. Regular rate for overtime compensation purposes must include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;on-call pay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shift differential&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;weekend differential&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;longevity pay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;commission payments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;payments for sold-back benefits (such as vacation or sick pay if the sale is during employment rather than a terminal benefit)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;safety, incentive, productivity, attendance, and merit bonuses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="two"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if my state has overtime requirements that differ from the FLSA?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State laws can have different requirements for overtime pay. As a result, you will want to check your state’s law and ensure that you are following the law that is most friendly to employees. In general, the rate of pay for overtime hours must be at least one and one-half times the employee’s regular rate of pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following chart contains information regarding state laws for overtime. This chart contains only the general overtime provisions. Situations where provisions may differ include small employers, employers of minors, employers in particular industries, and public sector employers. Additionally, the chart generally does not address exemptions from state law overtime requirements. You should not rely solely on this chart and should be sure to familiarize yourself thoroughly with the law of your state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that the law that is the most favorable to employees, whether federal or state, is the law that &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be followed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/Affordable-Care-Act"&gt;Avoiding penalties under the Affordable Care Act&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;p&gt;The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has been around since 2010 but it is still relatively new to a lot of people, including employers. For employers, it’s really important to be ahead of the curve when it comes to labor law to avoid possibly hefty fines and penalties. So here’s a run-down of the Section 4980H ­(the “Play-or-Pay” mandate), recordkeeping requirements, and the possible penalties for violating the ACA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="two"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the Section 4980H–Employer ‘Play-or-Pay’ Mandate? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As added by the ACA, section 4980H of the Internal Revenue Code requires that all “large” employers (those with 50 or more employees) must provide health care coverage that meets minimum essential benefits requirements to all full-time employees and their children or pay a penalty. The coverage must provide the &lt;strong&gt;minimum value&lt;/strong&gt; to plan participants and must be &lt;strong&gt;affordable&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “minimum value” standard is a health plan that can pay at least 60% of the total cost of medical services for a standard population. The coverage is considered “affordable” – as it relates to the premium tax credit – if the employee’s share of the annual premium for the lowest priced self-only plan is no greater than 9.56% of the annual household income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="two"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the requirements for large employers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All “large” employers are those with 50 or more employees. They must provide the minimum essential coverage (MEC) to at least 70% of their full-time employees (and their children). For determining coverage of the ACA, “employee” is defined either as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;an employee who works 30 or more hours per week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="no-bullet" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a “full-time equivalent” employee, which is counted by dividing the total number of monthly hours worked by part-time employees by 120.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Part-time” employees are counted towards determining ACA coverage, but are not included for purposes of the “Play-or-Pay” penalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="two"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any requirements for smaller employers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small employers, those with fewer than 50 full-time equivalent employees, are not subject to the “Play-or-Pay” mandate. In order to encourage small employers to offer medical insurance, the ACA provides tax credit to qualifying small employers. To be eligible for a credit, the employer must pay at least 50% of employee health care coverage. Additionally, to be eligible for the credit, a small employer must:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;have no more than 25 full-time equivalent employees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="no-bullet" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pay an average wage of less than $50,000 per year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the maximum credit will only be available to employers that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;have 10 or fewer full-time equivalent employees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="no-bullet" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pay an average wage of less than $25,000 per year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="two"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the recordkeeping requirements?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ACA requires employers and/or health insurance issuers to report the IRS information about employer-sponsored health coverage. The Form &lt;a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-dft/f1095c--dft.pdf"&gt;1095-C&lt;/a&gt; (Employer-Provided Health Insurance Offer and Coverage) is to be used to report the required information with respect to each covered employee, and Form &lt;a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-dft/f1094c--dft.pdf"&gt;1094-C&lt;/a&gt; is used to transmit the 1095-C return to the IRS. The IRS will use these forms to determine whether the employer owes a penalty under Section 4980-H.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="two"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the possible penalties for violating Section 4980-H?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large employers could face two types of penalties, depending on whether or not they choose to offer health care coverage to employees. The two separate penalties are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="bold noafter" style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Do not offer coverage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="no-bullet" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;Large employers that do not offer coverage and have at least one full-time employee receiving a premium tax credit from the government under the ACA must pay a penalty of $2,000 per full-time employee (excluding the first 30 full-time employees).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="no-bullet" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="bold noafter" style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Do offer coverage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="no-bullet" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;Large employers that do not offer coverage, but have at least one full-time employee receiving a premium tax credit und the ACA because the employer offers coverage that does not meet the “minimum value” or is “affordable,” must pay the lesser of $3,000 per employee receiving a premium credit or $2,000 per full-time employee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="two"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking for more details about the Affordable Care Act?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/termination-reason"&gt;Termination Series: Communicating the reason for discharge&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;h2 class="one"&gt;Do employers need to provide a reason to a discharged employee?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal law does not require employers to provide terminated employees with a written explanation for their discharge. However, many states have litigation in place that calls for an employer to provide documentation outlining the reason for termination. This is a called a &lt;strong&gt;service letter&lt;/strong&gt;, and some state laws decree that you give this to the employee immediately upon termination while others only require a service letter to be issued upon an employee’s request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="two"&gt;Be honest and succinct&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of state law, it is usually a good idea to let an employee know why they are being terminated and to keep a record of this information. When conducting a termination, you should honestly state the reason for discharge. &lt;strong&gt;The explanation should be&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;factual and brief&lt;/strong&gt;. In some cases, an employer’s failure to state the true reason for the termination or stating reasons inconsistently has been considered evidence of bad faith or discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="two note noafter" style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="two" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;Don’t try to avoid difficult discharge decisions by classifying the discharge as a “layoff.” Calling a discharge a layoff can be dangerous if a true layoff did not occur as the error may be enough for a reasonable juror to determine the employer’s reason is a pretext for discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="two"&gt;Steer clear of defamation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid giving defamatory or derogatory reasons for termination. This means you should be sure to not communicate a statement to the employee that may injure his or her reputation, especially if the statement may not be factual. A defamation claim typically is comprised of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a false and defamatory statement (a statement that injures the reputation or community standing of another person or discourages others from associating with that person)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concerning the plaintiff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that is “published” or communicated to a third party&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with fault amounting to at least negligence (some states have not required a showing of fault or negligence if the plaintiff is a private person and the defendant is not a member of the media)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="no-bullet" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with proof of damages or a presumption of damages to the plaintiff as a matter of law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ex-employee may bring a defamation claim if an employer gives information to prospective employers without a release. However, employers should also be aware that a subsequent employer could possibly sue the former employer for negligent referral if the employee commits the same type of wrongful conduct she or he committed at the previous job. Careful consideration should be given to any communication regarding the reason for the termination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the reason for discharge is documented, the documented reason must be the &lt;strong&gt;same reason&lt;/strong&gt; that was stated to the discharged employee in the event that the employee files for wrongful termination. In the event that the termination involves a complicated matter, you may wish to seek legal counsel before drafting a separation notice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/I9-Immigration-Answers"&gt;Ask the Experts: I-9, W-9, E-Verify and more!&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These questions and answers are excerpts from our webinar on 6/9/15, “&lt;strong&gt;Avoid ICE knocking on Your Door: I-9 E-Verify and Immigration Compliance,&lt;/strong&gt;” which was presented by &lt;a href="http://www.cavanaghlaw.com/attorneys/bio/30"&gt;Julie Pace&lt;/a&gt; of the Cavanagh Law Firm. You can watch the entire webinar these questions and answers came from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhcKC3e40I"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; “If we complete an audit and realize that we have blank spots that the employee did not complete with an “n/a,” should we leave it or go back to the employee to write the n/a in the box?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie:&lt;/strong&gt; “Avoid blank spaces and put a dash to show it was not skipped. I would avoid ‘N/A.’ Use a dash instead. A dash does not disrupt the scans and it shows you thought about it, it wasn’t available, and that’s how you thought it out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If someone puts in their birth date into the current date area and crosses it out, should they initial or just fill out a new form?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie:&lt;/strong&gt; “Let’s look at section 1 of the I-9 Form. Let’s say the person wrote their birth date wrong or wrote it backwards. You have to do it in a certain format of (mm/dd/yyyy). Let’s say you’re proofing it and they did it backwards. They can actually strike through with a straight line, you can have the employee do that. So, a single strike through so it’s legible the agents can read it and they don’t see anything covered up. Then write the new date below it and then date it, and initial it. And if you correct I-9’s after the person has worked there, that would be something to have the employee sign, initial, and date it in that same little box to show when they altered it. If it’s a new hire, you just start over – you can shred the first one and move on from it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;“Could you please explain why it is important for a new employee to complete a W-9 along with a W-4?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie: &lt;/strong&gt;“Employers cannot specify which documents employees use. Employees may choose not to show you a Social Security card. As an employer, we want to have something to verify what we’re relying on for their Social Security number. The W-9 really helps to show good faith in immigration compliance and it also helps you with the IRS. If you end up paying someone who’s not in our workforce, and it turns out that is not their Social Security number, it goes into the unapplied earnings, then the IRS can target companies for penalties over that financially. They can’t really do that if you have a W-9 signed. It’s a very easy form to get signed with the W-4, right at the time you’re hiring people and they just sign it as an individual. They cannot put a Taxpayer ID number on there because the IRS does give people who are undocumented a (TIN) so they can file their taxes, but they can’t do that to work for you, they must put their Social Security Number.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; “&lt;/strong&gt;If they are presenting a list A document for the I-9, why would we require a W-9?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie:&lt;/strong&gt; “Because the I-9 Form is solely for the federal government and it’s only their form. It cannot be given to contractors, or companies that say, ‘Show me your I-9 to do business with me,’ or to state law enforcement, state employment agencies, who all make these mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The W-9 is designed for the IRS, for law enforcement inquiries, and also we use it with ICE that we are showing good faith and that we are paying underthe correct Social Security Number, since Social Security numbers are the most abused out there. And we do not necessarily want a copy of the Social Security card, because they’re counterfeited enough to where an agent would say, ‘Hey, you should have known this was counterfeited. Now that you have a photocopy of that document, we’re going to target you for it.’ The W-9 is a very effective tool for when a police officer comes by and says, ‘Hey, I need some documents to show for identity theft.’ Your response can be, ‘I can’t give you an I-9 form, but I can give you a W-9 and a W-4 that were signed, and we’ll move on.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Can't you use the Social Security Database check to help with verification?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie:&lt;/strong&gt; “I would not recommend that. That used to be an old program, the SSNDS, it’s kind of fraught with problems, first of all. The government views it that the Social Security card and number is not an immigration document. So, if it comes back that it doesn’t match, there’s 17.1% of people who don’t match their name and social; they’re still perfectly legal to work. The problem is you get into a bind where you are getting information from the Social Security database that says it doesn’t match and then what do you do with it? Now you’re starting to go down that path of constructive knowledge by ICE that says, ok, you took the extra step to check that database and now that you’ve checked it, now we think you should have know or done something further about it. And yet, you’re not allowed to fire them and theirs case law that says if you do, you can be targeted for back wages and damages because it is not an immigration database.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What do we do with the W-9 besides just having it?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie:&lt;/strong&gt; “Just put it in your regular personnel files. You’re not allowed to put I-9 forms with your personnel files, but you’re absolutely allowed to put W-9’s with your personnel files, so that’s the easiest way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What if my state doesn’t have a driver’s license issuing authority?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie:&lt;/strong&gt; “In some states, driver’s licenses don’t have an issuing authority, and you just have to look at the card and it will show. For example, the state of Arizona doesn’t have one, but if you look at the card and it says Arizona, you can put ‘State of Arizona’ or ‘AZ DL’ and that’s fine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is it ok for the employer to type up the I-9 and have the employee review and sign or MUST the employee fill the form out?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie:&lt;/strong&gt; “We used to do that in the old days, but I wouldn’t today. I know it’s faster, but if you’re in a high risk industry, I wouldn’t do it. I’d let the employee do it in their own handwriting, especially if you’re in a high risk industry.  Until we get a legal status program through congress, and get some immigration reform done, police officers and ICE agents may target  the HR person and say the manager was helping them in making up the information, so they could get the worker. We want it in their own handwriting so they can’t target you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is it okay to have the new hire fill out the I-9 prior to the first scheduled day of work?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie: &lt;/strong&gt;“Yes, you may do that. That helps a lot, because they can fill it out, the date they start is later, and you’re getting all of your ducks in a row ahead of time. So no problem about that, a lot of people do that, good choice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;“Should you have employees fill out new I-9s periodically or should they only be completed at time of hire?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie:&lt;/strong&gt; “You’re prohibited, generally from having I-9’s completed after someone starts, unless you’re doing an audit and you see a mistake, and you realize something needs to be done. It’s supposed to be done once at the time of hire and not looked at, unless you’re doing an internal audit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We have seasonal employees that only work in the summer. Do I need to re-verify if they are classified as seasonal employees?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie:&lt;/strong&gt; “If someone’s rehired within three years after the original I-9 is completed: employers may complete Section 3 of the original Form I-9 after verifying that Section 1 information is still accurate. If it’s more than three years after the I-9, you just complete a new I-9. If you previously completed section 3, you can complete a new I-9. And some people just do I-9’s everytime an employee comes in, so keep that in mind as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Can you fire someone if they give you false documents?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie:&lt;/strong&gt; “Sure, if you find out that someone is not legal to work, you absolutely can let them go. You just say, ‘We do things by the book, we’re immigration compliant, we’re sorry, that’s the way it is and we’re going to have to separate your employment.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If you’ve always retained photocopies of documents, should you get rid of those?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie:&lt;/strong&gt; “If you’re not under a government audit now, you can audit your I-9’s get them up to speed and follow your retention rules and do that as of today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Do you have to sign up for E-verify?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie: &lt;/strong&gt;“In some states, we do a lot of federal government contract work. So for Davis-Bacon and contractors, you do have to sign up for E-verify for federal contract work. So, there’s some states where it’s required and some states, it’s voluntary.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/politics-in-the-workplace"&gt;Politics in the workplace: how to remain legally compliant during election season&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;p&gt;With the election approaching, and presidential campaigns underway, the water cooler discussions have already started. While it is natural for employees to discuss current events at the workplace, how far should the political discussions reach? What are an employer’s obligations to keep the office politics free?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="two"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limiting political discussions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the First Amendment governs free speech rights, the protections apply only to state action. Employers have the ability to regulate political discussion in the workplace. First Amendment protections do apply to public employers and protects a public employee’s rights to free speech. While some states have statutes that regulate free speech in the work place, others do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clear employment policy is the best way for employers to control politics in the workplace. Employers can discipline or discharge an employee for violation of workplace policies, as long as the policy is applied consistently to all employees. In most cases, employers should reserve discipline or discharge to instances where the employee’s conduct interferes with his/her work activities or creates a disruption in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="two"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Political activities away from work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An employer must be careful when regulating an employee’s off duty conduct. In general, before considering a policy or practice that regulates an employee’s off-duty political speech, an employer must determine whether there is a legitimate business reason to limit the conduct. Examples of a legitimate business activity might include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the company’s reputation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;disruption to the workplace and employee morale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;potential legal liability to the employer because of the conduct&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;loss of business relationships related to the conduct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absent a legitimate business reason, employers can face claims of discrimination, or claims for invasion of privacy for trying to regulate non-work-related conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="two"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Political campaigning at work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="two note noafter" style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Non-solicitation policies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="two" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;Generally, employers can require that employees refrain from activities, such as campaigning, or passing out political literature during their work hours, excluding breaks and meal times. Employers with non-solicitation policies may apply those policies evenly with respect to all areas of solicitation, including selling cookies for a child’s school fundraiser, to soliciting for political purposes. Employers must be mindful of the NLRB’s protection of employee’s ability to protected concerted activity for their “mutual aid and protection.” These rules allow employees to generally discuss the terms and conditions of employment. Because the NLRA protects union-related activities (but not political speech), employers must take great care to distinguish the two when establishing a non-solicitation policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="two note noafter" style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Political dress, including badges and buttons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="two" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;When it comes to employees wearing badges, buttons, or other political dress, an employer may establish a neutral dress code that prohibits the employee from wearing T-shirts or other types of clothing. However, with respect to badges and buttons, the NLRA will allow employees to wear badges or buttons that are related to a union or to unionization as long as doing so does not create a safety hazard, or impact another legitimate business purpose. In general, if an employee is wearing a political button that also includes a union message, employers should refrain from prohibiting that activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="two" style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;Therefore, when considering a policy to regulate political speech and solicitation, employers should consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Applying a neutrally enforced policy that restricts solicitation only during work hours (not on lunch breaks or rest breaks), employers can refuse to let employees distribute or post political flyers at work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a good idea to send out a reminder to employees of your policy in the weeks leading up to Election Day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If an employer prohibits wearing political buttons or posting political posters, the company should be certain that the prohibition is followed absolutely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employers can also ban political slogan buttons or T-shirts as part of your dress code policy, particularly for employees who come into contact with clients or customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ban must be uniformly applied – if anyone (including the company president) wears a political election button, the ban loses its force and an employee disciplined for violating the policy may have a claim for wrongful discipline or discharge, or even coercion under state law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any embargo on buttons may not extend to union buttons worn during a union organization or election as this is protected under the NLRA, but more about that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="two"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use of an employer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;’s company equipment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employer company equipment includes items such as bulletin boards, copy machines, telephones and computer systems. While employees enjoy limited rights to solicit and distribute union-related materials on company property, an employee enjoys no such right with respect to use an employer’s equipment for union or other purposes, including political campaigning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employers who wish to control the use of their company’s computer systems, including email, must have and regularly enforce an electronic communication policy that warns employees that the computer systems are company property and that regulates the type of discussion that can take place on a computer system. An employer can limit the political discourse that takes place on its computer systems through an electronics communication policy,.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="two"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asking employees to support employers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;’ political views&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under federal law, employers have some ability to ask executive or administrative personnel who are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and have policymaking, managerial, professional or supervisory responsibilities to vote for or against a particular political candidate.  This ability does not apply to the rank and file employees. However, employers are restricted from influencing employees’ actions in state elections. It is a violation of the election laws for a person acting alone or through another person to directly or indirectly subject any person to undue influence with intent to induce any person to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;register or vote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;refrain from registering or voting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;register or vote in any particular manner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;be or refrain from or cease being a candidate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;contribute or refrain from contributing to any candidate, political party or political committee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;render or refrain from rendering services to any candidate, political party or political committee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;challenge or refrain from challenging a person offering to vote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;apply or refrain from applying for an absentee ballot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;sign or refrain from signing a prospective petition or an initiative, referendum, recall or candidate nominating petition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Undue influence” under this statute means “force, violence, restraint or the threat of it, inflicting injury, damage, harm, loss of employment or other loss or the threat of it, or giving or promising to give money, employment or other thing of value.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/DOL-Exemption-Changes"&gt;Ask the Experts: The DOL&#039;s Proposed Exemption Changes&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These questions and answers are excerpts from our webinar on 8/6/15, “&lt;strong&gt;The New Exemption Regulations.. Coming Soon to Your Workplace!&lt;/strong&gt;” which was presented by &lt;a href="http://www.ogletreedeakins.com/people/charles-e-mcdonald-iii"&gt;Chuck McDonald&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ogletreedeakins.com/people/steven-f-pockrass"&gt;Steve Pockrass&lt;/a&gt; of Ogletree Deakins. You can watch the entire webinar these questions and answers came from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i08sDBX6go8" target="_blank"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Could non-discretionary compensation include employer contributions to retirement or employer contributions towards health insurance?” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steve:&lt;/strong&gt; ”The DOL has said that in calculating the salary, it is not inclined to include any type of fringe benefits, such as retirement contributions, value of health insurance, all of those other things that add a lot of costs to what you pay to your employees, both exempt or non-exempt, but especially if you have a good fringe benefit package for your salaried, exempt employees, they are not planning to allow you to count any of that toward the minimum compensation level.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Would they continue to use the 40th percentile going forward? In other words, next year, the 40th percentile might be $60,000.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steve:&lt;/strong&gt; “That’s exactly the question they’re asking us to comment on; Should they use the 40&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile going forward? Or should they [DOL] adjust it every year based upon the CPIU. If they set it at the 40&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile now, how should the annual increases be measured, what methodology…. should they be annual increases? Or should they be increased at some other variation, and how much notice do you get for those increases?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“How does this affect Professional Employees, specifically in K-12 public educationand teaching contracts?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chuck&lt;/strong&gt;: “Assuming that people are classified as a professional, exempt teacher; these changes really wouldn’t impact them, because teachers, lawyers and physicians are exempt from the salary requirement under the FLSA, so this should not impact teachers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Would employees have to not only meet the salary test as well as the duties test? We can't just raise the salary and call them exempt.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steve: “&lt;/strong&gt;That’s correct. No matter what happens with the new regulations, they’ll still have to meet the salary requirements and the duties requirements under the new regulations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We currently pay our janitor a set salary &amp; withhold taxes as opposed to contract labor. Can this be considered a non-exempt salaried individual?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steve:&lt;/strong&gt; “The answer to that, unless that janitor has some sort of administrative or managerial responsibilities, for example: is the head of a department and is truly performing exempt work. The fact that you’re simply paying him a salary does not make him exempt. He’s got to be meeting both the job duty and minimum salary requirements.  So if you’re paying a janitor a salary, and you’re covered by the Fair Labor Standards act, then you’re not meeting the proper requirements. If the janitor is working overtime, then you should be paying overtime on top of the salary to the janitor. That’s the requirement and because the janitor would be non-exempt, you need to keep appropriate records of the hours worked and the other requirements for a non-exempt employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Is there anything on the horizon regarding other exemptions such as that for agriculture?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chuck: “&lt;/strong&gt;Not that we know right now, and with everything going on knowing that the minimum wage is going to be the next hot topic and an election year coming up,  I would be surprised to see anything in any other area of any other industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;“What are the chances these changes are going through?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chuck:&lt;/strong&gt; “I think it’s clear they’re going through, they’re going to get passed.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; What should we comment on?”&lt;strong&gt; [Regarding comments on the new regulations. Find out how to comment on the proposed regulations HERE] &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chuck:&lt;/strong&gt; “That depends on your industry and your particular business. I think you need to be realistic with your comments and send comment sthat have a chance to have an impact.  The things I would concentrate on are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does there need to be an automatic increase every year, or should it be every 2 years or 3 years?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re going to use the 40&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile, does it all have to go in one jump next summer, or should we taper it in over a 6 month or 12 month period?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another is the Primary Duties Test: I don’t think people understand how significant a 50% rule test, would be; it would basically wipe out any kind of Asst. Manager, it would wipe out a lot of people in that administrative exemption. If you have a 50% test, basically you have to exempt duties 50% of the time, and currently under the current primary duties test, it’s just that has to be your primary duty. I think indicating and writing comments that if the salaries going up as high as they’re proposing, the primary duties test should stay the same is definitely something that employers want to happen. The worst thing that could happen is to have the salary go up to 50,00, get doubled, and also have a percent, such as 50% or even 25% test in the primary duty,  is just going to make it that much harder and is probably going tosubstantially increase the amount of litigation we’d see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; "What about nurses, social workers &amp; chaplains in a hospice?” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steve: &lt;/strong&gt;“Nurses and social workers don’t fall under that special rule. There are special overtime rules with regard to nurses in certain facilities known as the ‘8 and 80 rules’. But in terms of whether a nurse or a social worker is going to fall within one of the executive, administrative, professional exemptions for overtime, they’re going to actually have to meet one of the 3 exemptions, meet the job duties test, and mee the minimum salary requirements in order to qualify for an exemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Are elected/appointed officials covered?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chuck:&lt;/strong&gt;  “I didn’t see anything in the proposed regs that specifically addressed that, to my knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steve:&lt;/strong&gt; “I did not either and I think that raises some serious concerns in terms of how this is going to impact public employers. Again, the job duties requirements will be the same for public employers, just as they are now they’ll be the same under the new regs, if there’s no changes in the job duties test. But then the whole minimum salary requirement could raise some serious problems and concerns for public employers. That’s certainly something employers could write comments on and raise concerns about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“So if you have a salaried sales rep who works as inside &amp; outside sales that also receives commission it has not yet been determined how the commission will effect the base salary?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chuck: &lt;/strong&gt;“The answer to that’s going to depend. If they’re doing inside and outside sales work, that could be a close call, because the department of labor takes the position that inside sales work is never going to be exempt. If they’ve got administrative functions, but they also do some outside sales, there are opportunities depending on how you pay them, to have a an argument that they meet the outside sales exemption but if they don’t, a fallback argument is the admin exemption, however, the only way to make that argument today is if you pay them a guaranteed salary that meets the 455. And then you can pay them commissions on top of that and then you have a fallback argument on top of that administrative exemption. When the salary amount increases, and if it goes to $50,000, let’s say, if you don’t pay a guaranteed salary $50,000 plus commissions you will lose the opportunity to have the administrative exemption as a fallback argument, which means if they don’t meet the primary duties test as an outside sales employee, then that’s a non-exempt position.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; “50% of our employees are outside sales and meet the primary duties test for the exemption. If there is no change to the primary duty test, will we still have to pay them a minimum of $50k?” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chuck:&lt;/strong&gt; “Outside Sales currently does not have a salary basis test and there is no indications in these regs that they’re going to change that. So if they’re truly performing outside sales, you can pay them straight commissions, draw commissions, however you want. But they’ve got to meet the outside sales primary duties test.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; “Inside sales are never exempt, in other words?” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steve:&lt;/strong&gt; “As a general matter, that’s correct. There are all sorts of special rules in certain industries that may result in overtime exemptions where you didn’t necessarily know about one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I work with Automotive industry (Sales and Service) in florida i understand commission employees are exempt from overtime; will this still be the case? So this rulling would apply to our office staff?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steve: &lt;/strong&gt;“That would be a separate rule that would apply. So in the issue of inside sales, the one area where we sometimes see an exemption that sometimes is inside sales in retail establishments. There’s a special rule for people who are commissioned salespeople in a retail establishment where they receive more than half of their income comes from commissions and their rate of pay is always more than 1 and a 1/2 times the minimum wage, when they work over 40 hours. So there are some special rules out there for certain industries that I think it is important to look at before we say that something is absolutely one way or absolutely the other.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>&lt;a href="/blog/fringe-benefits"&gt;Employee fringe benefits&lt;/a&gt;</Title>
    <Body>&lt;p class="one"&gt;Creating a competitive employee benefits package can be a daunting task. Healthcare costs are rising and it’s becoming increasingly difficult to attract top talent on a medical insurance offering alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="one"&gt;In an effort to increase job satisfaction, many employers and HR directors are turning to fringe benefits to beef up an employee’s total compensation­.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="two"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a fringe benefit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="one"&gt;A fringe benefit is generally a form of non-cash compensation paid to an employee. The term was derived during World War II, when government-mandated wage increases were prohibited in many industries. Employers began relying on fringe benefits to attract and reward employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="one"&gt;Examples of fringe benefits include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="one"&gt;company parties or trips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vacation pay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;employee discounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use of company machinery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tickets to sporting events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;transportation fare&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;educational assistance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="two"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why would an employer provide fringe benefits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="one"&gt;Great employees are hard to find and retaining these workers is even more challenging. However, as health insurance prices increase, many employers have needed to shift a lot of the brunt of healthcare costs to their employees, leaving them without the competitive benefits package that can help instill loyalty in desired talent. Many employers are looking to fringe benefits in order to appeal to employees while still offsetting their healthcare costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="two"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the IRS tax fringe benefits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="one"&gt;Fringe benefits provided to employees are taxable unless there is a specifically applicable income tax exclusion. Some benefits can be categorized as &lt;em&gt;de minimis &lt;/em&gt;fringe benefits, which means they are a property or service of so little value it is impractical to account for the benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="one"&gt;Examples of &lt;em&gt;de minimis &lt;/em&gt;benefits would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;occasional meals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;company parties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;non-cash holiday gifts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="one"&gt;With some exceptions, other tax-free fringe benefits can include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;accident insurance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stock options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health Savings Accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;moving expenses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;educational assistance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="one"&gt;More information about tax requirements and exclusions is provided &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p15b/ar02.html#en_US_2016_publink1000193623"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on the IRS website.&lt;/p&gt;
